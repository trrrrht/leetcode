**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `arr`, replace each element with its rank.

The rank represents how large the element is. The rank has the following rules:

- Rank is an integer starting from 1.
- The larger the element, the larger the rank. If two elements are equal, their rank must be the same.
- Rank should be as small as possible.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [40,10,20,30]
Output: [4,1,2,3]
Explanation: 40 is the largest element. 10 is the smallest. 20 is the second smallest. 30 is the third smallest.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [100,100,100]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation: Same elements share the same rank.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [37,12,28,9,100,56,80,5,12]
Output: [5,3,4,2,8,6,7,1,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= arr[i] <= 109`
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> arrayRankTransform(vector<int>& arr) {
        if (arr.size() == 0) {
            return arr;
        }
        vector<int> tmp(arr);
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        sort(tmp.begin(), tmp.end());
        int count = 1;
        umap[tmp[0]] = count++;
        for (int i = 1; i < tmp.size(); i++) {
            if (tmp[i] != tmp[i - 1]) {
                umap[tmp[i]] = count++;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            arr[i] = umap[arr[i]];
        }
        return arr;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just keep an array to remember the ID of each number.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
