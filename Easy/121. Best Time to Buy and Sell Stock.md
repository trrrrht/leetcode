**Problem:**

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.

Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
             Not 7-1 = 6, as selling price needs to be larger than buying price.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Solution:**

My first version of solution is use a n length array to store the min number before one specific value, and in the loop, I calculate the max minus result.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        vector<int> sell;
        if (prices.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        sell.push_back(prices[0]);
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            sell.push_back(min(prices[i], sell[i - 1]));
        }
        int max = prices[0] - sell[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (max < prices[i] - sell[i]) {
                max = prices[i] - sell[i];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```

But then I figure out that I don't have to remember every element, I can just remember one which is the smallest one before current element.

Then the code changes to:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int sell;
        if (prices.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        sell = prices[0];
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (sell > prices[i]) {
                sell = prices[i];
            }
            if (prices[i] - sell > max) {
                max = prices[i] - sell;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```

And when I check others' solutions, I find a interesting way to solve this problem.

Remember that we know the "53. Maximum Subarray", we can see the profits as a new array, then using the Kadane's Algorithm

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    	int currProfit = 0, maxProfit = 0; 
    	for(int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++)
    	{
    	    currProfit = max(currProfit += prices[i] - prices[i-1], 0);
     	    maxProfit = max(currProfit, maxProfit);
   		}
  	    return maxProfit;
	}
};
```
