**Problem:**
Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.*

**Follow up:** Could you implement a solution using only `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` runtime complexity?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: 1
Explanation: n = 1 since there is 1 number, so all numbers are in the range [0,1]. 1 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**.

**My Solution:**
```
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        nums.emplace_back(-1);
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] >= 0 && nums[i] != i) {
                swap(nums[nums[i]], nums[i]);
                i--;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
```

Correctness:

Since the scale of the number in this array is from 0 to n, we can put them in the right place (nums[i] = i). In that case, during the two-pass scan, we can find the missing number.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution 1:**
We can also calculate the sum of the array if we don't miss this number by using gauss' formula($\frac{n (n+1)}{2}$). And if we use this number to minus the actual sum of this array, we can get the number we are missing.

**Other Solution 2:**
```
int missingNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int missing = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            missing ^= i ^ nums[i];
        }
        return missing;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can use the reorder of XOR function. As we know, (A ^ B) ^ C = A ^ (B ^ C), A ^ A = 0 and 0 ^ A = A. In that case, if we want to find the missing number, we should use all the number in the array do XOR with their indices. For example, if we miss 2 in [0, 1, 3, 4], we will get the equation like missing = 4 ∧ (0 ∧ 0) ∧ (1 ∧ 1) ∧ (2 ∧ 3) ∧ (3 ∧ 4) =(4 ∧ 4) ∧ (0 ∧ 0) ∧ (1 ∧ 1) ∧ (3 ∧ 3) ∧ 2 = 0 ∧ 0 ∧ 0 ∧ 0 ∧ 2 = 2

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
