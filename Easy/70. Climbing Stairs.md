**Problem:**
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb `1` or `2` steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 45`
**My Solution:**
```
int climbStairs(int n) {
        vector<int> steps = {1, 2};
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) {
            return steps[n - 1];
        }
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            int r = (i - 1) % 2;
            steps[r] = steps[0] + steps[1];
        }
        return steps[(n - 1) % 2];
    }
```
Correctness:

The equation is F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
