**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the **same length**. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `ith` position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string.

Return *the shuffled string*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/07/09/q1.jpg)

```
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
Explanation: As shown, "codeleet" becomes "leetcode" after shuffling.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
Explanation: After shuffling, each character remains in its position.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `s.length == indices.length == n`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `0 <= indices[i] < n`
- All values of `indices` are **unique**.

**Other Solution:**
```
string restoreString(string s, vector<int>& indices) {
        for(int i=0;i<indices.size();i++)
        {
              while(indices[i]!=i)
              {
                  swap(s[i],s[indices[i]]);
                  swap(indices[i],indices[indices[i]]);
                       
              }
        }
        return s;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
