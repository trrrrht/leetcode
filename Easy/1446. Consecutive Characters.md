**Problem:**
The **power** of the string is the maximum length of a non-empty substring that contains only one unique character.

Given a string `s`, return *the **power** of* `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 2
Explanation: The substring "ee" is of length 2 with the character 'e' only.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
Output: 5
Explanation: The substring "eeeee" is of length 5 with the character 'e' only.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxPower(string s) {
        int max_len = 0, curr_len = 0;
        char prev = s[0];
        
        for (auto letter : s){
            if (letter == prev)
                curr_len++;
            else
                curr_len = 1;
            
            max_len = max(max_len, curr_len);
            prev = letter;
        }
        
        return max_len;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
