**Problem:**
In a deck of cards, each card has an integer written on it.

Return `true` if and only if you can choose `X >= 2` such that it is possible to split the entire deck into 1 or more groups of cards, where:

- Each group has exactly `X` cards.
- All the cards in each group have the same integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: deck = [1,2,3,4,4,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: deck = [1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: deck = [1]
Output: false
Explanation: No possible partition.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: deck = [1,1]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1].
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: deck = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation: Possible partition [1,1],[2,2],[2,2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= deck.length <= 104`
- `0 <= deck[i] < 104`

**My Solution:**
```
bool hasGroupsSizeX(vector<int>& deck) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        for (int i = 0; i < deck.size(); i++) {
            umap[deck[i]] += 1;
        }
        int x = umap[deck[0]];
        for (int i = 1; i < deck.size(); i++) {
            x = __gcd(x, umap[deck[i]]);
        }
        if (x < 2) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < deck.size(); i++) {
            if (umap[deck[i]] % x != 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

Because we want to find the group of same integer, we can use a map to save the frequency of all the numbers. However, we should pay attention to the number of integers in each group. For example, for [1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2], we should group them as [1, 1], [1, 1], [2, 2]. In this case, we know we should find all the gcd of the frequency to decide the number of integers in a group.

Complexity:

Time: O($nlog^2n$)
Space: O(n)
