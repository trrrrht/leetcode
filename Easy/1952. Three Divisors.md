**Problem:**
Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if* `n` *has **exactly three positive divisors**. Otherwise, return* `false`.

An integer `m` is a **divisor** of `n` if there exists an integer `k` such that `n = k * m`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explantion: 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explantion: 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
ic:
    bool isThree(int n) {
        int d = 2;
        for (int i = 2; i < n && d <= 3; i += 1)
            d += n % i == 0;
        return d == 3;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
