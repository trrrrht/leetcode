**Problem:**
A sequence of numbers is called an **arithmetic progression** if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

Given an array of numbers `arr`, return `true` *if the array can be rearranged to form an **arithmetic progression**. Otherwise, return* `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,5,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We can reorder the elements as [1,3,5] or [5,3,1] with differences 2 and -2 respectively, between each consecutive elements.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to reorder the elements to obtain an arithmetic progression.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `-106 <= arr[i] <= 106`
**My Solution:**
```
bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr) {
        sort(arr.begin(), arr.end());
        int difference = arr[1] - arr[0];
        for (int i = 2; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            if (arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != difference) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

After sorting, we get the min differences of the sequence. If all the differences are the same, then we can return true. If not, however we rearrange the sequence, we can not get the differences the same, because we can make the two number who is neighbour to each other in the sorting array and the other two neighbours as a pair to exchange the positions (if before are not true, after are not true too). 

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
**Other Solution:**
```
bool canMakeArithmeticProgression(vector<int>& arr)
    {
        if (arr.size() <= 2) return true;
        int min = INT_MAX, max = INT_MIN;
        for (int num : arr) {
            min = std::min(min, num);
            max = std::max(max, num);
        }
        if ((max - min) % (arr.size() - 1) != 0) return false;
        int d = (max - min) / (arr.size() - 1);

        int i = 0;
        while (i < arr.size()) {
            if (arr[i] == min + i * d) i++;
            else if ((arr[i] - min) % d != 0) return false;
            else {
                int pos = (arr[i] - min) / d;
                if (pos < i || arr[pos] == arr[i]) return false;
                std::swap(arr[i], arr[pos]);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want all the differences to be the same, we could firstly find the max and the min in the array to get the target. And for each number in the array, we should check whether they are in the sequence, and swap them to the correct place.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
