**Problem:**
In a string `s` of lowercase letters, these letters form consecutive groups of the same character.

For example, a string like `s = "abbxxxxzyy"` has the groups `"a"`, `"bb"`, `"xxxx"`, `"z"`, and `"yy"`.

A group is identified by an interval `[start, end]`, where `start` and `end` denote the start and end indices (inclusive) of the group. In the above example, `"xxxx"` has the interval `[3,6]`.

A group is considered **large** if it has 3 or more characters.

Return *the intervals of every **large** group sorted in **increasing order by start index***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with start index 3 and end index 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: []
Explanation: We have groups "a", "b", and "c", none of which are large groups.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
Explanation: The large groups are "ddd", "eeee", and "bbb".
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: []
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` contains lower-case English letters only.
**My Solution:**
```
vector<vector<int>> largeGroupPositions(string s) {
        int count = 1;
        int index = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        for (int i = 1; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == s[i - 1]) {
                if (count == 1) {
                    index = i - 1;
                }
                count++;
                if (i == s.size() - 1 && count >= 3) {
                    vector<int> result = {index, i};
                    results.emplace_back(result);
                }
            }
            if (s[i] != s[i - 1]) {
                if (count >= 3) {
                    vector<int> result = {index, i - 1};
                    results.emplace_back(result);
                }
                count = 1;
                index = i;
            }
        }
        return results;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to find the consecutive groups of the same character and the length is larger than 3, we can scan the array from the start to the end and compare s[i] and s[i - 1] to decide what we should do.

Also, we can use two pointers, whose code is simpler.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
