**Problem:**
There is an `m x n` matrix that is initialized to all `0`'s. There is also a 2D array `indices` where each `indices[i] = [ri, ci]` represents a **0-indexed location** to perform some increment operations on the matrix.

For each location `indices[i]`, do **both** of the following:

1. Increment **all** the cells on row `ri`.
2. Increment **all** the cells on column `ci`.

Given `m`, `n`, and `indices`, return *the **number of odd-valued cells** in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in* `indices`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
The final matrix is [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]], which contains 6 odd numbers.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/30/e2.png)

```
Input: m = 2, n = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Final matrix = [[2,2],[2,2]]. There are no odd numbers in the final matrix.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= indices.length <= 100`
- `0 <= ri < m`
- `0 <= ci < n`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve this in `O(n + m + indices.length)` time with only `O(n + m)` extra space?
**My Solution:**
```
int oddCells(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& indices) {
        vector<int> rows(m, 0);
        vector<int> columns(n, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < indices.size(); i++) {
            int row = indices[i][0];
            int column = indices[i][1];
            rows[row]++;
            columns[column]++;
        }
        int even = 0;
        int odd = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (rows[i] & 1) {
                odd++;
            }
            else {
                even++;
            }
        }
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (columns[i] & 1) {
                result += even;
            }
            else {
                result += odd;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can use two 1-dimension arrays to replace one 2-dimension to save the cell that should be add 1. After that, we should check how many times each row(column) have been increased and save the number of even and odd numbers. Since we want to calculate all the odd values, for each column(row), if the value is odd, we should add the row(column)'s even and vice versa.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
