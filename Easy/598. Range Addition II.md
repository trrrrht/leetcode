**Problem:**
You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and an array of operations `ops`, where `ops[i] = [ai, bi]` means `M[x][y]` should be incremented by one for all `0 <= x < ai` and `0 <= y < bi`.

Count and return *the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/02/ex1.jpg)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = [[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3],[2,2],[3,3],[3,3],[3,3]]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, ops = []
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 4 * 104`
- `1 <= ops.length <= 104`
- `ops[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= ai <= m`
- `1 <= bi <= n`
**My Solution:**
```
int maxCount(int m, int n, vector<vector<int>>& ops) {
        int row = m;
        int column = n;
        for (int i = 0; i < ops.size(); i++) {
            row = min(row, ops[i][0]);
            column = min(column, ops[i][1]);
        }
        return row * column;
    }
```
Correctness:

Because we have to increase the value of the sub-matrix according to the indices, we should get the maximum overlap

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
