**Problem:**
You are given an `n x n` `grid` where you have placed some `1 x 1 x 1` cubes. Each value `v = grid[i][j]` represents a tower of `v` cubes placed on top of cell `(i, j)`.

After placing these cubes, you have decided to glue any directly adjacent cubes to each other, forming several irregular 3D shapes.

Return *the total surface area of the resulting shapes*.

**Note:** The bottom face of each shape counts toward its surface area.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[2]]
Output: 10
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/08/tmp-grid2.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 34
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,0],[0,2]]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/08/tmp-grid4.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 32
```

**Example 5:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/08/tmp-grid5.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[2,2,2],[2,1,2],[2,2,2]]
Output: 46
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`
**My Solution:**
```
int surfaceArea(vector<vector<int>> grid) {
        int res = 0, n = grid.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j]) res += grid[i][j] * 4 + 2;
                if (i) res -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i - 1][j]) * 2;
                if (j) res -= min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j - 1]) * 2;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the calculating process

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space:  O(1)
