**Problem:**
Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s.
    The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```



**Note:**

- The input array will only contain `0` and `1`.
- The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000
**My Solution:**
```
int findMaxConsecutiveOnes(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int maxcount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i]) {
                count++;
            }
            else {
                count = 0;
            }
            if (maxcount < count) {
                maxcount = count;
            }
        }
        return maxcount;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is very easy. When we meet 1, we know we should add 1 to the consecutive array. When we meet 0, we know we should start from 0.

Complexity:

Time: O(N)
Space: O(1)
