**Problem:**
You are given a string `word` that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.

You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, `"a123bc34d8ef34"` will become `" 123 34 8 34"`. Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: `"123"`, `"34"`, `"8"`, and `"34"`.

Return *the number of **different** integers after performing the replacement operations on* `word`.

Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations **without any leading zeros** are different.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "a123bc34d8ef34"
Output: 3
Explanation: The three different integers are "123", "34", and "8". Notice that "34" is only counted once.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "leet1234code234"
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word = "a1b01c001"
Output: 1
Explanation: The three integers "1", "01", and "001" all represent the same integer because
the leading zeros are ignored when comparing their decimal values.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 1000`
- `word` consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int numDifferentIntegers(string w) {
        unordered_set<string> s{""};    
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; j <= w.size(); ++j) {
            if (j < w.size() && isdigit(w[j]))
                i += i < j && w[i] == '0';
            else {
                s.insert(w.substr(i, j - i));
                i = j + 1;
            }
        }
        return s.size() - 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
