**Problem:**
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists `headA` and `headB`, return *the node at which the two lists intersect*. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return `null`.

For example, the following two linked lists begin to intersect at node `c1`:

It is **guaranteed** that there are no cycles anywhere in the entire linked structure.

**Note** that the linked lists must **retain their original structure** after the function returns.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 8, listA = [4,1,8,4,5], listB = [5,6,1,8,4,5], skipA = 2, skipB = 3
Output: Intersected at '8'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 8 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [4,1,8,4,5]. From the head of B, it reads as [5,6,1,8,4,5]. There are 2 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intersectVal = 2, listA = [1,9,1,2,4], listB = [3,2,4], skipA = 3, skipB = 1
Output: Intersected at '2'
Explanation: The intersected node's value is 2 (note that this must not be 0 if the two lists intersect).
From the head of A, it reads as [1,9,1,2,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [3,2,4]. There are 3 nodes before the intersected node in A; There are 1 node before the intersected node in B.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/05/160_example_3.png)

```
Input: intersectVal = 0, listA = [2,6,4], listB = [1,5], skipA = 3, skipB = 2
Output: No intersection
Explanation: From the head of A, it reads as [2,6,4]. From the head of B, it reads as [1,5]. Since the two lists do not intersect, intersectVal must be 0, while skipA and skipB can be arbitrary values.
Explanation: The two lists do not intersect, so return null.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes of `listA` is in the `m`.
- The number of nodes of `listB` is in the `n`.
- `0 <= m, n <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= Node.val <= 105`
- `0 <= skipA <= m`
- `0 <= skipB <= n`
- `intersectVal` is `0` if `listA` and `listB` do not intersect.
- `intersectVal == listA[skipA + 1] == listB[skipB + 1]` if `listA` and `listB` intersect.

 

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that runs in `O(n)` time and use only `O(1)` memory?
**Other Solution:**
```
ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
        ListNode* pointerA = headA;
        ListNode* pointerB = headB;
        while(pointerA != pointerB)
        {
            if(pointerA != NULL)
            {
                pointerA = pointerA->next;
            }
            else
            {
                pointerA = headB;
            }
            if(pointerB != NULL)
            {
                pointerB = pointerB->next;
            }
            else
            {
                pointerB = headA;
            }
        }
        return pointerA;
    }
```
Correctness:

Let the equal part of A and B lists be C, the intersected node be N, the rest part be the new A and B. In this case, the two lists could be represent as A N C and B N C. If every time we reach the end of one list and then assign the pointer to the head of another list, we will get new fake lists: A N C B N C and B N C A N C. Although the length of A and B might not be equal, the length of A N C B and B N C A must be equal, so we could find N in the next round.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
