**Problem:**
Given an array `arr`, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with `-1`.

After doing so, return the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
Explanation: 
- index 0 --> the greatest element to the right of index 0 is index 1 (18).
- index 1 --> the greatest element to the right of index 1 is index 4 (6).
- index 2 --> the greatest element to the right of index 2 is index 4 (6).
- index 3 --> the greatest element to the right of index 3 is index 4 (6).
- index 4 --> the greatest element to the right of index 4 is index 5 (1).
- index 5 --> there are no elements to the right of index 5, so we put -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [400]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There are no elements to the right of index 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 105`
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> replaceElements(vector<int>& arr) {
        int rightmax = -1;
        for (int i = arr.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int tmp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = rightmax;
            rightmax = max(rightmax, tmp);
        }
        return arr;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to replace all the values to its right-most value, we just have to scan the array from the right to the left and find the maximum to replace them.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
