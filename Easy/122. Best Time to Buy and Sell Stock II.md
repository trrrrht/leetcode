**Problem:**

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Solution:**

If there is a non-descending continuous subset, and the next number is a descending number, we can use the last element in this subset minus the first element in this subset.

Through the graph of the total array, we can know that if we use these method to scan this array, and add all the minus result together, we can get the max profit.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int sell = prices[0];
        int max = 0;
        int flag = 0;
        int i;
        int remember = 0;
        for (i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                flag++;
                continue;
            }
            else {
                flag = 0;
                max += prices[i - 1] - sell;
                sell = prices[i];
                remember = i;
            }
        }
        if (prices.size() - 1 - remember == flag) {
            max += prices[prices.size() - 1] - prices[remember];
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```

And if we see the graph, we can find that if prices[i] - prices[i - 1] > 0, then we can make profit, just like this:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        if (prices.size() <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int max = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                max += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
};
```
