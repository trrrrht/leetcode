**Problem:**
Given a string `path`, where `path[i] = 'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'` or `'W'`, each representing moving one unit north, south, east, or west, respectively. You start at the origin `(0, 0)` on a 2D plane and walk on the path specified by `path`.

Return `true` *if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if at any time you are on a location you have previously visited*. Return `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: path = "NES"
Output: false 
Explanation: Notice that the path doesn't cross any point more than once.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: path = "NESWW"
Output: true
Explanation: Notice that the path visits the origin twice.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= path.length <= 104`
- `path[i]` is either `'N'`, `'S'`, `'E'`, or `'W'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool isPathCrossing(string path) {
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        set<pair<int, int>> visited;
        visited.insert(make_pair(x, y));
        for (const auto& c : path) {
            if (c == 'N')
                y++;
            else if (c == 'S')
                y--;
            else if (c == 'W')
                x--;
            else if (c == 'E')
                x++;

            auto newPoint = make_pair(x, y);
            if (visited.count(newPoint))
                return true;
            else
                visited.insert(newPoint);
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
