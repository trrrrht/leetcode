**Problem:**
**Balanced** strings are those that have an equal quantity of `'L'` and `'R'` characters.

Given a **balanced** string `s`, split it in the maximum amount of balanced strings.

Return *the maximum amount of split **balanced** strings*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
Output: 4
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
Output: 3
Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
Output: 1
Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either `'L'` or `'R'`.
- `s` is a **balanced** string.
**Other Solution:**
```
int balancedStringSplit(string s) {
        int res = 0, cnt = 0;
        for (const auto& c : s) {
            cnt += c == 'L' ? 1 : -1;
            if (cnt == 0) ++res;
        }
        return res;        
    }
```
