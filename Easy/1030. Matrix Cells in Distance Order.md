**Problem:**
You are given four integers `row`, `cols`, `rCenter`, and `cCenter`. There is a `rows x cols` matrix and you are on the cell with the coordinates `(rCenter, cCenter)`.

Return *the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their **distance** from* `(rCenter, cCenter)` *from the smallest distance to the largest distance*. You may return the answer in **any order** that satisfies this condition.

The **distance** between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rows = 1, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 0
Output: [[0,0],[0,1]]
Explanation: The distances from (0, 0) to other cells are: [0,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rows = 2, cols = 2, rCenter = 0, cCenter = 1
Output: [[0,1],[0,0],[1,1],[1,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (0, 1) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2]
The answer [[0,1],[1,1],[0,0],[1,0]] would also be accepted as correct.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: rows = 2, cols = 3, rCenter = 1, cCenter = 2
Output: [[1,2],[0,2],[1,1],[0,1],[1,0],[0,0]]
Explanation: The distances from (1, 2) to other cells are: [0,1,1,2,2,3]
There are other answers that would also be accepted as correct, such as [[1,2],[1,1],[0,2],[1,0],[0,1],[0,0]].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rows, cols <= 100`
- `0 <= rCenter < rows`
- `0 <= cCenter < cols`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<vector<int>> allCellsDistOrder(int R, int C, int r0, int c0) {
        vector<vector<int>> res = { { r0, c0 } };
        auto max_d = max({ r0 + c0, c0 + R - r0, r0 + C - c0, R - r0 + C - c0 });
        for (auto d = 1; d <= max_d; ++d)
            for (int x = d; x >= -d; --x) {
            auto r1 = r0 + x, c1_a = c0 + d - abs(x), c1_b = c0 + abs(x) - d;
            if (r1 >= 0 && r1 < R) {
                if (c1_a >= 0 && c1_a < C) 
                    res.push_back({ r1, c1_a });
                if (c1_a != c1_b && c1_b >= 0 && c1_b < C) 
                    res.push_back({ r1, c1_b });
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
