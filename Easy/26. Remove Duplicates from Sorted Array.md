**Problem**:

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Solution**:

This problem tells me how to delete some elements in a array.

If we wanna keep the order of the array, we can use **unique** and **erase** to delete the duplicated numbers.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int>::iterator iter;
        iter = unique(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        nums.erase(iter, nums.end());
        return nums.size();
    }
};
```

Also, we can also use iterator to delete numbers.

If we just wanna delete some elements in one array, we can **swap it with the last elements** and then use **pop_back** to delete it.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int tmp = nums[0];
        int count = 1;
        for (vector<int>::iterator iter = nums.begin() + 1; iter < nums.end();) {
            if (*iter == tmp) {
                iter = nums.erase(iter);
            }
            else {
                tmp = *iter;
                count++;
                iter++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
