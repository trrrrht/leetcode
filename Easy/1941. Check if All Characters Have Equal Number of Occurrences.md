**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, return `true` *if* `s` *is a **good** string, or* `false` *otherwise*.

A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abacbc"
Output: true
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaabb"
Output: false
Explanation: The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool areOccurrencesEqual(string s) {
        unordered_map<char, int> freq;
        for (auto c : s) freq[c]++;
        int val = freq[s[0]];
        for (auto [a, b] : freq) if (b != val) return false;
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
