**Problem:**
Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, return *the length of the **longest palindrome*** that can be built with those letters.

Letters are **case sensitive**, for example, `"Aa"` is not considered a palindrome here.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abccccdd"
Output: 7
Explanation:
One longest palindrome that can be built is "dccaccd", whose length is 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase **and/or** uppercase English letters only.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestPalindrome(string s) {
        unordered_map<int,int> mp;
        int res = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            mp[s[i]]++;
            if(mp[s[i]]%2==0) {
                res += mp[s[i]];
                mp[s[i]] = 0;
            }
        }
        for(auto x: mp) {
            if(x.second==1) {
              res++;
              break;
            }  
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

When two chars are the same, they could be one part of the palindrome. After getting all the pairs, we could add one more single char to the palindrome.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
