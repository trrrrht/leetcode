**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `nums`, half of the integers in `nums` are **odd**, and the other half are **even**.

Sort the array so that whenever `nums[i]` is odd, `i` is **odd**, and whenever `nums[i]` is even, `i` is **even**.

Return *any answer array that satisfies this condition*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,5,7]
Output: [4,5,2,7]
Explanation: [4,7,2,5], [2,5,4,7], [2,7,4,5] would also have been accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `nums.length` is even.
- Half of the integers in `nums` are even.
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

**My Solution:**
```
 vector<int> sortArrayByParityII(vector<int>& nums) {
        int even = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i += 2) {
            while (even < nums.size() && nums[even] % 2 == 0) {
                even += 2;
            }
            if (nums[i] % 2 == 0) {
                swap(nums[i], nums[even]);
                even += 2;
            }
        }
        return nums;
    }
```
Correctness:

According to the problem, we just have to scan the array and swap the even number to the even index.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
