**Problem:**
Write an algorithm to determine if a number `n` is happy.

A **happy number** is a number defined by the following process:

- Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
- Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it **loops endlessly in a cycle** which does not include 1.
- Those numbers for which this process **ends in 1** are happy.

Return `true` *if* `n` *is a happy number, and* `false` *if not*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
**Other Solution:**
```
int digitSquareSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0, tmp;
        while (n) {
            tmp = n % 10;
            sum += tmp * tmp;
            n /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    bool isHappy(int n) {
        int slow, fast;
        slow = fast = n;
        do {
            slow = digitSquareSum(slow);
            fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
            fast = digitSquareSum(fast);
            if(fast == 1) return 1;
        } while(slow != fast);
         return 0;
    }   
```
Correctness:

Since the number will end in a loop, we use two pointers with different speed to detect whether the loop contains 1.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
