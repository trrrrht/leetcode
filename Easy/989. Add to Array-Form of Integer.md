**Problem:**
The **array-form** of an integer `num` is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

- For example, for `num = 1321`, the array form is `[1,3,2,1]`.

Given `num`, the **array-form** of an integer, and an integer `k`, return *the **array-form** of the integer* `num + k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: num = [2,7,4], k = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: num = [2,1,5], k = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: num = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9], k = 1
Output: [1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: 9999999999 + 1 = 10000000000
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= num.length <= 104`
- `0 <= num[i] <= 9`
- `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
- `1 <= k <= 104`
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> addToArrayForm(vector<int>& num, int k) {
        int size = num.size();
        int overflow = k;
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int r = (num[i] + overflow) % 10;
            overflow = (num[i] + overflow) / 10;
            num[i] = r;
            if (overflow == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        while (overflow) {
            int r = overflow % 10;
            overflow /= 10;
            num.insert(num.begin(), r);
        }
        return num;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since the scale of the number is too large, we can not change it to integer and then add it to k. We can simulate how addition works. However, when we want to insert overflow to the number, we should know that insert a bit to the first of the array takes O(n) time. In this case, we can actually reverse the result array before insert overflow and then add them, which will reduce running time.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
