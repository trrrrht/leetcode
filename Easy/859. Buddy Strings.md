**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `goal`, return `true` *if you can swap two letters in* `s` *so the result is equal to* `goal`*, otherwise, return* `false`*.*

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices `i` and `j` (0-indexed) such that `i != j` and swapping the characters at `s[i]` and `s[j]`.

- For example, swapping at indices `0` and `2` in `"abcd"` results in `"cbad"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
Explanation: The only letters you can swap are s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b', which results in "ba" != goal.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'a' to get "aa", which is equal to goal.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 2 * 104`
- `s` and `goal` consist of lowercase letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool buddyStrings(string A, string B) {
        if (A.length() != B.length()) return false;
        if (A == B && set<char>(A.begin(), A.end()).size() < A.size()) return true;
        vector<int> dif;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length(); ++i) if (A[i] != B[i]) dif.push_back(i);
        return dif.size() == 2 && A[dif[0]] == B[dif[1]] && A[dif[1]] == B[dif[0]];
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Time: O(n)
