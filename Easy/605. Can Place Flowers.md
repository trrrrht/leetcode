**Problem:**
You have a long flowerbed in which some of the plots are planted, and some are not. However, flowers cannot be planted in **adjacent** plots.

Given an integer array `flowerbed` containing `0`'s and `1`'s, where `0` means empty and `1` means not empty, and an integer `n`, return *if* `n` new flowers can be planted in the `flowerbed` without violating the no-adjacent-flowers rule.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 1
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: flowerbed = [1,0,0,0,1], n = 2
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= flowerbed.length <= 2 * 104`
- `flowerbed[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- There are no two adjacent flowers in `flowerbed`.
- `0 <= n <= flowerbed.length`
**My Solution:**
```
bool canPlaceFlowers(vector<int>& flowerbed, int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int size = flowerbed.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (flowerbed[i] == 0) {
                if ((i > 0 && flowerbed[i - 1] == 1) || (i + 1 < size && flowerbed[i + 1] == 1)) {
                    continue;
                }
                else {
                    flowerbed[i] = 1;
                    count++;
                }
            } 
            if (count >= n) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can scan the array to find the 0 without 1 as neighbours and replace 0 with 1, in which way we will end up in the maximum number of flowers, because we use all the 0 we can.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
