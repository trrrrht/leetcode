**Problem:**
You are given a string `sentence` that consist of words separated by spaces. Each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters only.

We would like to convert the sentence to "Goat Latin" (a made-up language similar to Pig Latin.) The rules of Goat Latin are as follows:

- If a word begins with a vowel (

  ```
  'a'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'e'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'i'
  ```

  ,

   

  ```
  'o'
  ```

  , or

   

  ```
  'u'
  ```

  ), append

   

  ```
  "ma"
  ```

   

  to the end of the word.

  - For example, the word `"apple"` becomes `"applema"`.

- If a word begins with a consonant (i.e., not a vowel), remove the first letter and append it to the end, then add

   

  ```
  "ma"
  ```

  .

  - For example, the word `"goat"` becomes `"oatgma"`.

- Add one letter

   

  ```
  'a'
  ```

   

  to the end of each word per its word index in the sentence, starting with

   

  ```
  1
  ```

  .

  - For example, the first word gets `"a"` added to the end, the second word gets `"aa"` added to the end, and so on.

Return *the final sentence representing the conversion from sentence to Goat Latin*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentence = "I speak Goat Latin"
Output: "Imaa peaksmaaa oatGmaaaa atinLmaaaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentence = "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog"
Output: "heTmaa uickqmaaa rownbmaaaa oxfmaaaaa umpedjmaaaaaa overmaaaaaaa hetmaaaaaaaa azylmaaaaaaaaa ogdmaaaaaaaaaa"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence.length <= 150`
- `sentence` consists of English letters and spaces.
- `sentence` has no leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `sentence` are separated by a single space.
**Other Solution:**
```
string toGoatLatin(string S) {
        unordered_set<char> vowel({'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'});
        istringstream iss(S);
        string res, w;
        int i = 0, j;
        while (iss >> w) {
            res += ' ' + (vowel.count(w[0]) == 1 ? w : w.substr(1) + w[0]) + "ma";
            for (j = 0, ++i; j < i; ++j) res += "a";
        }
        return res.substr(1);
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
