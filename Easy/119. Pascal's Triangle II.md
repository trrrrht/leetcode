**Problem:**

Given a non-negative index *k* where *k* â‰¤ 33, return the *k*th index row of the Pascal's triangle.

Note that the row index starts from 0.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

**Example:**

```
Input: 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

**Follow up:**

Could you optimize your algorithm to use only *O*(*k*) extra space?

**Solution:**

My solution is using two vectors to swap the value in order to find next array

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        vector<int> pre = {1};
        vector<int> in = {1, 1};
        if (rowIndex == 0) {
            return pre;
        }
        else if (rowIndex == 1) {
            return in;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < rowIndex; i++) {
            pre.resize(i + 1);
            copy(in.begin(), in.end(), pre.begin());
            in.resize(i + 2);
            in[0] = 1;
            in[i + 1] = 1;
            for (int j = 1; j < i + 1; j++) {
                in[j] = pre[j] + pre[j - 1];
            }
        }
        return in;
    }
};
```

But actually, by seeing the input, we can just use one array to finish this problem.

It's just like a translation, for example:

if we take the picture in the description, in the 4 row (start from number 1), if we store them from the last to first, we can say that the element[j] in 5 row is the result of element[j] + element[j + 1], which is similar to the gif

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int rowIndex) {
		vector <int> row(rowIndex+1,1);
		for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; ++i) {	
			for (int j = (rowIndex-i)+1; j < rowIndex; ++j){
				row[j] = row[j] + row[j+1];
			}
		}
		return row;
	}
};
```

And if you have learned the combination number, you will know the numbers in the pascal's triangle are those in combination. The i-th element is C(n, i)

So the solution is:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> getRow(int n) {
        vector<int> res(n+1, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            res[i] = res[n-i] = (long long)res[i-1] * (n+1-i) / i;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
