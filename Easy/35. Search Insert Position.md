**Problem:**

Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` contains **distinct** values sorted in **ascending** order.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`

**My Solution:**

```
int searchInsert(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        int low = 0;
        int mid = 0;
        while (low <= high) {
            mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else if (nums[mid] > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        if (target < nums[mid]) {
            return mid;
        }
        else {
            return mid + 1;
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

It's almost the same as binary search algorithm but with a different end. If we can not find the target number in the array, we should check the mid number now is bigger or smaller than target and returen the index.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
Also, we can just return the low index because we can know from the algorithm if we can not find the target number, the step before the last step of the loop should make mid == high == low. In that case, if nums[mid] > target, low remains and if nums[mid] < target, low should be mid + 1. In either case, it's the correct index of the insertion.
