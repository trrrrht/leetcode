**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` formed by digits and `'#'`. We want to map `s` to English lowercase characters as follows:

- Characters (`'a'` to `'i')` are represented by (`'1'` to `'9'`) respectively.
- Characters (`'j'` to `'z')` are represented by (`'10#'` to `'26#'`) respectively.

Return *the string formed after mapping*.

The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "10#11#12"
Output: "jkab"
Explanation: "j" -> "10#" , "k" -> "11#" , "a" -> "1" , "b" -> "2".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "1326#"
Output: "acz"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of digits and the `'#'` letter.
- `s` will be a valid string such that mapping is always possible.
**Other Solution:**
```
string freqAlphabets(string s) {
        string res;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (i < s.size() - 2 && s[i + 2] == '#') {
              res += 'j' + (s[i] - '1') * 10 + s[i + 1] - '0';
              i += 2;
            }
            else res += 'a' + (s[i] - '1');
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
