**Problem:**
A **sentence** is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is **uncommon** if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and **does not appear** in the other sentence.

Given two **sentences** `s1` and `s2`, return *a list of all the **uncommon words***. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "apple apple", s2 = "banana"
Output: ["banana"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 200`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of lowercase English letters and spaces.
- `s1` and `s2` do not have leading or trailing spaces.
- All the words in `s1` and `s2` are separated by a single space.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<string> uncommonFromSentences(string A, string B) {
        unordered_map<string, int> count;
        istringstream iss(A + " " + B);
        while (iss >> A) count[A]++;
        vector<string> res;
        for (auto w: count)
            if (w.second == 1)
                res.push_back(w.first);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
