**Problem:**
Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return *the number of **negative** numbers in* `grid`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[4,3,2,-1],[3,2,1,-1],[1,1,-1,-2],[-1,-1,-2,-3]]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,-1],[-1,-1]]
Output: 3
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: grid = [[-1]]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an `O(n + m)` solution?
**My Solution 1:**
```
int binarysearch(vector<int> vec, double target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = vec.size() - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (vec[mid] > target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
    
    int countNegatives(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            int position = binarysearch(grid[i], -0.5);
            count += grid[i].size() - position;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since the row of the matrix is sorted, we can use binary search to find the start of the negative number in each row and calculate the number of them.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
**My Solution 2:**
```
int countNegatives(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int count = 0;
        int row = grid.size();
        int column = grid[0].size();
        int j = column - 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < row; i++) {
            while (j >= 0 && grid[i][j] < 0) {
                j--;
            }
            count += column - j - 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since all the rows and columns are sorted, for each row, we just have to find the last negative from the end to the start and continue search next row. For each row, we continue add j instead of searching from the begining, so the running time is O(n)

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
