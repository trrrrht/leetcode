**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `numbers` that is already ***sorted in ascending order\***, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific `target` number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (**1-indexed**) as an integer array `answer` of size `2`, where `1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length`.

You may assume that each input would have **exactly one solution** and you **may not** use the same element twice.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= numbers.length <= 3 * 104`
- `-1000 <= numbers[i] <= 1000`
- `numbers` is sorted in **increasing order**.
- `-1000 <= target <= 1000`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& numbers, int target) {
        vector<int> result;
        int i = 0;
        int j = numbers.size() - 1;
        while (i < j) {
            int sum = numbers[i] + numbers[j];
            if (sum > target) {
                j--;
            }
            else if (sum < target) {
                i++;
            }
            else {
                result.emplace_back(i + 1);
                result.emplace_back(j + 1);
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

This problem is exactly like problem 1 Two Sum and we don't have to use sort to perfrom two pointers algorithm.

Also, we can actually use binary search or hash table to solve this problem, which was discussed in problem 1.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
