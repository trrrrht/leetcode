**Problem:**
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a **sorted** list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/merge_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: l1 = [1,2,4], l2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: l1 = [], l2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in both lists is in the range `[0, 50]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- Both `l1` and `l2` are sorted in **non-decreasing** order.
**Other Solution:**
```
ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        if (l1 == NULL) { return l2; }
        if (l2 == NULL) { return l1; }
        ListNode* merged = NULL;
        if(l1->val <= l2->val) {
            merged = l1;
            l1 = l1->next;
        } else {
            merged = l2;
            l2 = l2->next;
        }
        merged->next = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2);
        return merged;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's merge sort

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
