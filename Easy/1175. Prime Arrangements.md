**Problem:**
Return the number of permutations of 1 to `n` so that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed.)

*(Recall that an integer is prime if and only if it is greater than 1, and cannot be written as a product of two positive integers both smaller than it.)*

Since the answer may be large, return the answer **modulo `10^9 + 7`**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 12
Explanation: For example [1,2,5,4,3] is a valid permutation, but [5,2,3,4,1] is not because the prime number 5 is at index 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 100
Output: 682289015
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 100`
**Other Solution:**
```
const long mod = 1000000007;
    long factorial(int n, int prime = 2, long start = 1) {
        long a = start;
        for (int i = prime; i <= n; i++) {
            a *= i;
            if (a >= mod) a %= mod;
        }
        return a;
    }
public:
    int numPrimeArrangements(int n) {
        int primes[] {2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97};
        int i = 0;
        for (; i < 25 && primes[i] <= n; i++);
        int minNum = i, rest = n - i;
        if (n < (i << 1)) swap(minNum, rest);
        
        long a = factorial(minNum), b = factorial(rest, minNum + 1, a);
        return (int)(a * b % mod);
    }
```
Correctness:

Assign all the prime numbers to prime position and the rest to other position.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
