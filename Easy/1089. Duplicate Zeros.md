**Problem:**
Given a fixed length array `arr` of integers, duplicate each occurrence of zero, shifting the remaining elements to the right.

Note that elements beyond the length of the original array are not written.

Do the above modifications to the input array **in place**, do not return anything from your function.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: null
Explanation: After calling your function, the input array is modified to: [1,2,3]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= arr.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`

**My Solution:**
```
void duplicateZeros(vector<int>& arr) {
        int count = 0;
        int index = -1;
        bool flag = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            count++;
            if (arr[i] == 0) {
                if (count == arr.size()) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
                count++;
            }
            if (count <= arr.size()) {
                index = i;
            }
        }
        int curindex = arr.size() - 1;
        if (flag) {
            arr[curindex--] = arr[index + 1];
        }
        for (int i = index; i >= 0 && curindex >= i; i--) {
            arr[curindex--] = arr[i];
            if (arr[i] == 0 && curindex >= i) {
                arr[curindex--] = arr[i];
            }
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

We can scan from the left to the right and calculate the number of the integers in the array. At some point, we will get the index(<= the size of the array - 1) that is larger of equal to the size of the array, because each zero is counted as two numbers. Also, we know count must be equal to array.size() or array.size() + 1. In this case, we can replace from the right to the left according to count and the index.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
