**Problem:**
In an alien language, surprisingly they also use english lowercase letters, but possibly in a different `order`. The `order` of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of `words` written in the alien language, and the `order` of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given `words` are sorted lexicographicaly in this alien language.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: true
Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, then the sequence is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, then words[0] > words[1], hence the sequence is unsorted.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: false
Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size.) According to lexicographical rules "apple" > "app", because 'l' > '∅', where '∅' is defined as the blank character which is less than any other character (More info).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.
**My Solution:**
```
bool isAlienSorted(vector<string>& words, string order) {
        unordered_map<char, int> umap;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            umap[order[i]] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < words.size(); i++) {
            string word1 = words[i - 1];
            string word2 = words[i];
            int j = 0;
            int k = 0;
            while (j < word1.size() && k < word2.size()) {
                if (umap[word1[j]] < umap[word2[k]]) {
                    break;
                }
                else if (umap[word1[j]] > umap[word2[k]]) {
                    return false;
                }
                else {
                    j++;
                    k++;
                }
            }
            if (j == word1.size() || k == word2.size()) {
                if (word1.size() > word2.size()) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

We first map the new order of char to numbers. And then we could check for each pair of neighbour words.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
