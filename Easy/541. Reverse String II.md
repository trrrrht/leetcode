**Problem:**
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and left the other as original.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcdefg", k = 2
Output: "bacdfeg"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "bacd"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 104`
**My Solution:**
```
string reverseStr(string s, int k) {
        for (int left = 0; left < s.size(); left += 2 * k) {
            for (int i = left, j = min(left + k - 1, (int)s.size() - 1); i < j; i++, j--) {
                swap(s[i], s[j]);
            }
        }
        return s;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
