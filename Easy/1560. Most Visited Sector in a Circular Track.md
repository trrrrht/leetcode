**Problem:**
Given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. We have a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of `m` rounds. The `ith` round starts at sector `rounds[i - 1]` and ends at sector `rounds[i]`. For example, round 1 starts at sector `rounds[0]` and ends at sector `rounds[1]`

Return *an array of the most visited sectors* sorted in **ascending** order.

Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 4, rounds = [1,3,1,2]
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The marathon starts at sector 1. The order of the visited sectors is as follows:
1 --> 2 --> 3 (end of round 1) --> 4 --> 1 (end of round 2) --> 2 (end of round 3 and the marathon)
We can see that both sectors 1 and 2 are visited twice and they are the most visited sectors. Sectors 3 and 4 are visited only once.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, rounds = [2,1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: [2]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 7, rounds = [1,3,5,7]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= m <= 100`
- `rounds.length == m + 1`
- `1 <= rounds[i] <= n`
- `rounds[i] != rounds[i + 1]` for `0 <= i < m`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> mostVisited(int n, vector<int>& rounds) {
        vector<int> res;
        for (int i = rounds[0]; i <= rounds[rounds.size() - 1]; ++i)
            res.push_back(i);
        if (res.size() > 0) return res;
        for (int i = 1; i <= rounds[rounds.size() - 1]; ++i)
            res.push_back(i);
        for (int i = rounds[0]; i <= n; ++i)
            res.push_back(i);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

If we simulate the process, for each round, there're two situations. The first one is the racer doesn't visit each sector, so visit time of the visited one are more than that of the un-visited one. The second one is th racer visits each sector multiple times. In this situation, we can see if he stops at the start or at the sector before the start. Then these sectors are visited more than the other ones. In this case, we know the sectors between start and end will always be visited more than the other, so we should put the firstly.

Complexity:
Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
