**Problem:**
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in **non-decreasing order** by height. Let this ordering be represented by the integer array `expected` where `expected[i]` is the expected height of the `ith` student in line.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the **current order** that the students are standing in. Each `heights[i]` is the height of the `ith` student in line (**0-indexed**).

Return *the **number of indices** where* `heights[i] != expected[i]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
heights:  [1,1,4,2,1,3]
expected: [1,1,1,2,3,4]
Indices 2, 4, and 5 do not match.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [5,1,2,3,4]
Output: 5
Explanation:
heights:  [5,1,2,3,4]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices do not match.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: heights = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 0
Explanation:
heights:  [1,2,3,4,5]
expected: [1,2,3,4,5]
All indices match.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 100`
**My Solution:**
```
int heightChecker(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> nums(101, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.size(); i++) {
            nums[heights[i]]++;
        }
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1, j = 0; i < 101; i++) {
            while (nums[i]) {
                if (heights[j] != i) {
                    count++;
                }
                j++;
                nums[i]--;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to find the height which is not in the right place, so we use the number that is ought to be in this place to compare with it. If they are equal, this one is correct. Otherwise, this one is incorrect.

Complexity:

Time: o(n)
Space: o(1)
