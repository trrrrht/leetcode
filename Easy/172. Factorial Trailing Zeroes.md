**Problem:**
Given an integer `n`, return *the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`*.

**Follow up:** Could you write a solution that works in logarithmic time complexity?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: 3! = 6, no trailing zero.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: 5! = 120, one trailing zero.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int sum=0;
        while(n / 5 > 0)
        {
            n /= 5;
            sum += n;
        }
        return sum;
     }
```
Correctness:

When we want to calculate the trailing zeros in n!, we will calculate the number of 10 in it, which could be produced by the products of 5 and 2. 

For example, if we want to know the number of trailing zeros in 23!, we should calculate the number of multiple of 5 in it. There are 4,that is 5, 10, 15, 20, which is 23 / 5 = 4. Then, if we want to know that of 100!,  we could calculate 100 / 5 = 20. However, this is not the ultimate number, because there's 25 in it and it could provide more 0s by multiply with other even numbers. In this case, we have to calculate the number of 5^2 in 100. The total number in 100! is 100 / 5^1 + 100 / 5^2 = 24

As discussed above, if we want to know the number of trailing zeros in n!, we should calculte how many 5^m are there in it.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
