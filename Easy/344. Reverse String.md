**Problem:**
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).

 

**Follow up:** Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.
**My Solution:**
```
void reverseString(vector<char>& s) {
        int i = 0, j = s.size() - 1;
        while(i < j){
            swap(s[i++], s[j--]); 
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

Just use two pointers to swap

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
