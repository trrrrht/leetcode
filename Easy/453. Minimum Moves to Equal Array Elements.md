**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return *the minimum number of moves required to make all array elements equal*.

In one move, you can increment `n - 1` elements of the array by `1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Only three moves are needed (remember each move increments two elements):
[1,2,3]  =>  [2,3,3]  =>  [3,4,3]  =>  [4,4,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- The answer is guaranteed to fit in a **32-bit** integer.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minMoves(vector<int>& nums) {
        int minMoves = 0, minElement = *min_element(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        
        for(int element:nums)
            minMoves += element - minElement;
        
        return minMoves;
    }
```
Correctness:

Increasing n - 1 elements by 1 is the same as decreasing 1 element by 1. In this case, we could just check the difference between each number and the minimum number

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
