**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to make* `s` *alternating*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "0100"
Output: 1
Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "10"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "1111"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minOperations(string s) {
        int res = 0, n = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (s[i] - '0' != i % 2)
                res++;
        return min(res, n - res);
    }
```
Correctness:

Assume 0s are at the even indices and 1s are at the odd indices. Compare the number of operations that change the number like we assume and that of vice versa to get the minimum

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
