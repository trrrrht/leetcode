**Problem:**
In a array `nums` of size `2 * n`, there are `n + 1` unique elements, and exactly one of these elements is repeated `n` times.

Return the element repeated `n` times.

 



**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums[1,2,3,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums[2,1,2,5,3,2]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums[5,1,5,2,5,3,5,4]
Output: 5
```

 

**Note:**

- `4 <= nums.length <= 10000`
- `0 <= nums[i] < 10000`
- `nums.length` is even
**My Solution:**
```
int repeatedNTimes(vector<int>& nums) {
        for (int i = 2; i < nums.size(); ++i)
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1] || nums[i] == nums[i - 2])
                return nums[i];
        return nums[0];
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is like pigeonhole principle. Since one of the elements repeats n times in 2 * n elements and others are all unique, if we separate the number as three-number-pair, we know at least one pair will contains two same numbers, which is the result we want. (also like voting algorithm)

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
