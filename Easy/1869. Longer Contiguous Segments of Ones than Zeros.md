**Problem:**
Given a binary string `s`, return `true` *if the **longest** contiguous segment of* `1`*s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of* `0`*s in* `s`. Return `false` *otherwise*.

- For example, in `s = "110100010"` the longest contiguous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`s, then the longest contiguous segment of `0`s is considered to have length `0`. The same applies if there are no `1`s.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1101"
Output: true
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "110100010"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
**My Solution:**
```
bool checkZeroOnes(string s) {
        int zeros = 0;
        int ones = 0;
        int tmpzero = 0;
        int tmpone = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            if (s[i] == '1') {
                tmpone++;
                ones = max(ones, tmpone);
                tmpzero = 0;
            }
            else {
                tmpzero++;
                zeros = max(zeros, tmpzero);
                tmpone = 0;
            }
        }
        return ones > zeros? true: false;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
