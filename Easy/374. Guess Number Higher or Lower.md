**Problem:**
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns three possible results:

- `-1`: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. `num > pick`).
- `1`: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. `num < pick`).
- `0`: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. `num == pick`).

Return *the number that I picked*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= pick <= n`
**Other Solution:**
```
int guessNumber(int n) {
        int maxNumber = n, minNumber = 1;
        while (true) {
            int meanNumber = (maxNumber - minNumber) / 2 + minNumber;
            int res = guess(meanNumber);
            if (res == 0) { 
                return meanNumber;
            } else if (res == 1) {
                minNumber = meanNumber + 1;
            } else {
                maxNumber = meanNumber - 1;
            }
        }
    }
```
