**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is **unique**.

Find whether the largest element in the array is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If it is, return *the index of the largest element*, otherwise, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: 6 is the largest integer and for every other number in the array x,
6 is more than twice as big as x.
The index of value 6 is 1, so we return 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: -1
Explanation: 4 is not at least as big as twice the value of 3, so we return -1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
- The largest element in `nums` is unique.
**My Solution:**
```
int dominantIndex(vector<int>& nums) {
        int maxnum = 0;
        int index = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] > maxnum) {
                if (maxnum * 2 <= nums[i]) {
                    index = i;
                }
                else {
                    index = -1;
                }
                maxnum = nums[i];
            }
            else {
                if (nums[i] * 2 > maxnum) {
                    index = -1;
                }
            }
        }
        return index;
    }
```
Correctness:

There are two situations. nums[i] is either larger than max number now or is smaller than it. When it's smaller, we should check whether nums[i] * 2 is larger. When it's bigger, we should update the max number and if the old max * 2 is smaller than the current number, we know this might be the one we want, so we should save the index. 

In two-pass algorithm, we can first find the largest number and then find if all the other number * 2 are smaller than it.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
