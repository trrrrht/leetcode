**Problem:**
We have two special characters. The first character can be represented by one bit `0`. The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Now given a string represented by several bits. Return whether the last character must be a one-bit character or not. The given string will always end with a zero.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 0, 0]
Output: True
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and one-bit character. So the last character is one-bit character.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]
Output: False
Explanation: 
The only way to decode it is two-bit character and two-bit character. So the last character is NOT one-bit character.
```



**Note:**

`1 <= len(bits) <= 1000`.

`bits[i]` is always `0` or `1`.
**My Solution:**
```
bool isOneBitCharacter(vector<int>& bits) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < bits.size()) {
            if (bits[i]) {
                i += 2;
            }
            else {
                if (i == bits.size() - 1) {
                    return true;
                }
                else {
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to simulate the decoding to see whether the last element is single bit.

Or we can check from the last value of the array.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
