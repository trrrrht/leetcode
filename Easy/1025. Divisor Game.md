**Problem:**
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `n` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

- Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < n` and `n % x == 0`.
- Replacing the number `n` on the chalkboard with `n - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` *if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, and Bob has no more moves.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: false
Explanation: Alice chooses 1, Bob chooses 1, and Alice has no more moves.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool divisorGame(int n) {
        return n % 2 == 0;
    }
```
Correctness:

If n is even, we could choose x = 1, the opponent will get n - 1, which is odd. Continue and the opponent will lose. If n is ood, we have to choost an odd x, the opponent will get n - x, which is a even. Continue and the opponent will win. In this case, we just have to return n % 2 == 0

Complexity:

Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
