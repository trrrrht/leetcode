**Problem:**
You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so `"a"` is considered a different type of stone from `"A"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: jewels = "z", stones = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50`
- `jewels` and `stones` consist of only English letters.
- All the characters of `jewels` are **unique**.
**My Solution:**
```
int numJewelsInStones(string jewels, string stones) {
        unordered_set<char> uset;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < jewels.size(); i++) {
            uset.insert(jewels[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < stones.size(); i++) {
            if (uset.find(stones[i]) != uset.end()) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
