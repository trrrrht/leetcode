**Problem:**
Given a `m * n` matrix of **distinct** numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in **any** order.

A lucky number is an element of the matrix such that it is the minimum element in its row and maximum in its column.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[3,7,8],[9,11,13],[15,16,17]]
Output: [15]
Explanation: 15 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,10,4,2],[9,3,8,7],[15,16,17,12]]
Output: [12]
Explanation: 12 is the only lucky number since it is the minimum in its row and the maximum in its column.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[7,8],[1,2]]
Output: [7]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= n, m <= 50`
- `1 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`.
- All elements in the matrix are distinct.
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> luckyNumbers (vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        unordered_set<int> uset;
        vector<int> result;
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            int minnum = INT_MAX;
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
                minnum = min(minnum, matrix[i][j]);
            }
            uset.insert(minnum);
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].size(); j++) {
            int maxnum = -INT_MAX;
            for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
                maxnum = max(maxnum, matrix[i][j]);
            }
            if (uset.find(maxnum) != uset.end()) {
                result.emplace_back(maxnum);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
**Other Solution:**
```

vector<int> luckyNumbers (vector<vector<int>>& matrix)
    {
        int m = matrix.size();
        int n = matrix[0].size();
        
        int maxMin = INT_MIN;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int min = INT_MAX;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++)
                min = std::min(min, matrix[i][j]);
            maxMin = std::max(maxMin, min);
        }

        int minMax = INT_MAX;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int max = INT_MIN;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++)
                max = std::max(max, matrix[i][j]);
            minMax = std::min(minMax, max);
        }
        
        if (maxMin != minMax) return vector<int> { };
        return vector<int> { maxMin };
    }
```
Correctness:

If there are lucky numbers, we know the number must be the maximum of row minimums or minimum of column maximums or both of them. 

Consider the number M = maximum of row minmums in the matrix. Let A be any number in the matrix and B be the number in the same row with M and in the same column with A. Assume A could be the lucky number, then it should be the minimum of its row. Since M is the maximum of row minmums, A should be smaller than or equal to M and B is larger than or equal to M. In this case, A could be the lucky number if and only if A is equal to M..

Consider the number N = minimum of column maximums. Let C be the number in the same row with M and in the same column with N. We know for sure N is larger than or equal to C and M is smaller than or equal to C. In this case, M is smaller or equal to N. If M is smaller than N, then for the maximum number X of the column of M, X is larger than N. In this case, M could not be the largest number of its column and it could not be the lucky number. And according to the proof before, N could not be lucky number too. In this situation, there's not lucky number. In conclusion, there's one and only one lucky number in the matrix when M is equal to N. Otherwise, there's no lucky number.
