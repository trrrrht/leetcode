**Problem:**
Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return *the square root of* `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

**Note:** You are not allowed to use any built-in exponent function or operator, such as `pow(x, 0.5)` or `x ** 0.5`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= x <= 231 - 1`
**My Solution:**
```
int mySqrt(int x) {
        int high = x;
        int low = 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid > x / mid) {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
            else if (mid < x / mid) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                return mid;
            }
        }
        return high;
    }
```
Correctness:

We could use binary search to reduce the running time.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
