**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in **non-decreasing** order, return *an array of **the squares of each number** sorted in non-decreasing order*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
Explanation: After squaring, the array becomes [16,1,0,9,100].
After sorting, it becomes [0,1,9,16,100].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is sorted in **non-decreasing** order.

 

**Follow up:** Squaring each element and sorting the new array is very trivial, could you find an `O(n)` solution using a different approach?
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> sortedSquares(vector<int>& nums) {
        int size = nums.size();
        vector<int> result(size);
        int i = 0;
        int j = size - 1;
        int k = size - 1;
        while (i <= j) {
            int j2 = nums[j] * nums[j];
            int i2 = nums[i] * nums[i];
            if (j2 > i2) {
                result[k--] = j2;
                j--;
            }
            else {
                result[k--] = i2;
                i++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just like the problem 88Â Merge Sorted Array, we can use the "scanned" value as the place we put our result to. Since if we scan the array from the start to the end or from the end to the start, we will both get the square from biggest to the smallest, we can just compare the them and put them in the result vector.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
