**Problem:**
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length. A **string swap** is an operation where you choose two indices in a string (not necessarily different) and swap the characters at these indices.

Return `true` *if it is possible to make both strings equal by performing **at most one string swap** on **exactly one** of the strings.* Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "bank", s2 = "kanb"
Output: true
Explanation: For example, swap the first character with the last character of s2 to make "bank".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "attack", s2 = "defend"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to make them equal with one string swap.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s1 = "kelb", s2 = "kelb"
Output: true
Explanation: The two strings are already equal, so no string swap operation is required.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 100`
- `s1.length == s2.length`
- `s1` and `s2` consist of only lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool areAlmostEqual(string s1, string s2) {
        vector<array<char, 2>> mis;
        for (auto i = 0; i < s1.size() && mis.size() < 3; ++i)
            if (s1[i] != s2[i])
                mis.push_back({mis.empty() ? s1[i] : s2[i], mis.empty() ? s2[i] : s1[i]});
        return mis.empty() || (mis.size() == 2 && mis[0] == mis[1]);
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
