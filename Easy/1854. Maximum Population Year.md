**Problem:**
You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `ith` person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `ith` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is **not** counted in the year that they die.

Return *the **earliest** year with the **maximum population***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]
Output: 1993
Explanation: The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]
Output: 1960
Explanation: 
The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.
The earlier year between them is 1960.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
- `1950 <= birthi < deathi <= 2050`
**My Solution:**
```
int maximumPopulation(vector<vector<int>>& logs) {
        vector<int> years(101, 0);
        for (int i = 0; i < logs.size(); i++) {
            int start = logs[i][0];
            int end = logs[i][1];
            years[start - 1950]++;
            years[end - 1950]--;
        }
        int population = years[0];
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < years.size(); i++) {
            years[i] += years[i - 1];
            if (population < years[i]) {
                index = i;
                population = years[i];
            }
        }
        return index + 1950;
    }
```
Correctness:

By using prefix sum, we could reduce the running time.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
