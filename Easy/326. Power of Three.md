**Problem:**
Given an integer `n`, return *`true` if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return `false`*.

An integer `n` is a power of three, if there exists an integer `x` such that `n == 3x`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 27
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 0
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: true
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 45
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-231 <= n <= 231 - 1`

 

**Follow up:** Could you solve it without loops/recursion?
**Other Solution:**
```
bool isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        return n > 0 && 1162261467 % n == 0;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we have to find the power of 3 in [-$2^{31}$, $2^{31}-1$], we should find the max number that is power of 3 in this range. And if that number % 3 is 0, it means n is a power of 3.

Complexity:

Time: O(1)
