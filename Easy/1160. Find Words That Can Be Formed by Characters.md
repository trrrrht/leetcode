**Problem:**
You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`.

A string is *good* if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once).

Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: 
The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100`
3. All strings contain lowercase English letters only.
**My Solution:**
```
int countCharacters(vector<string>& words, string chars) {
        vector<int> vec(26, 0);
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.size(); i++) {
            vec[chars[i] - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            string word = words[i];
            vector<int> v(26, 0);
            for (int j = 0; j < word.size(); j++) {
                v[word[j] - 'a']++;
            }
            bool flag = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                if (v[j] > vec[j]) {
                    flag = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!flag) {
                result += word.size();
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to check each string to find if it can be formed by characters.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
