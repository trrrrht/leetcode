**Problem:**
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return *the number of non-empty **subarrays** with a sum* `goal`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of the array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= goal <= nums.length`
**Other Solution:**
```
int atmost(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        if (goal < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int result = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        int pre = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            while (sum > goal) {
                sum -= nums[pre];
                pre++;
            }
            result += i - pre + 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    int numSubarraysWithSum(vector<int>& nums, int goal) {
        return atmost(nums, goal) - atmost(nums, goal - 1);
    }
```
Correctness:

In this algorithm, atmost means find the number of subarray in nums that sum up from 0 to goal. In detail, For each current element we are checking, if the numbers between index pre and i are sumed up to goal, we know the there must be i - pre + 1 subarrays whose sum is equal or smaller than goal. In this case, to get the number of subarray whose sum is exactly goal, we should use atmost(goal) - atmost(goal - 1)

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
