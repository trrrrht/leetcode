**Problem:**

Given an array `nums` of *n* integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= nums.length <= 10^3`
- `-10^3 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`
- `-10^4 <= target <= 10^4` 



**My Solution:**
```
int threeSumClosest(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int result;
        int size = nums.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int j = i + 1;
            int k = size - 1;
            while(j < k) {
                if (abs(nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] - target) < abs(result - target)) {
                    result = nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k];
                }
                if (nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] > target) {
                    k--;
                }
                else if (nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] < target){
                    j++;
                }
                else {
                    return target;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can solve this problem using algorithm like the one in problem 1 Two Sum. As we can see, we should search all the numbers to find the proper first number. And then, we use two pointers to find the other two. The idea is basiclly the same as the one in problem 1. For each step of searching, we should drop one number. 

For example, if in the first searching, the sum of these three numbers are bigger than the target, we can know that if we want the sum to be closer than now, we should make the sum smaller. In that case, we should drop the last number because in any case, if we use this number, we can not get a smaller result.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
Also, we can fix two numbers and use binary search to find the last one.
