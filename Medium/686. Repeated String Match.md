**Problem:**
Given two strings `a` and `b`, return the minimum number of times you should repeat string `a` so that string `b` is a substring of it. If it is impossible for `b` to be a substring of `a` after repeating it, return `-1`.

**Notice:** string `"abc"` repeated 0 times is `""`, repeated 1 time is `"abc"` and repeated 2 times is `"abcabc"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "abcd", b = "cdabcdab"
Output: 3
Explanation: We return 3 because by repeating a three times "abcdabcdabcd", b is a substring of it.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "a", b = "aa"
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: a = "a", b = "a"
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: a = "abc", b = "wxyz"
Output: -1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length <= 104`
- `1 <= b.length <= 104`
- `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int repeatedStringMatch(string A, string B) {
        for (auto i = 0, j = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            for (j = 0; j < B.size() && A[(i + j) % A.size()] == B[j]; ++j);
            if (j == B.size()) 
                return (i + j - 1) / A.size() + 1;
        }
        return -1;
    }
```
Correctness:

This is basically a modified version of string find, which does not stop at the end of A, but continue matching by looping through A.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
