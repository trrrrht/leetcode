**Problem:**
According to [Wikipedia's article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life): "The **Game of Life**, also known simply as **Life**, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970."

The board is made up of an `m x n` grid of cells, where each cell has an initial state: **live** (represented by a `1`) or **dead** (represented by a `0`). Each cell interacts with its [eight neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_neighborhood) (horizontal, vertical, diagonal) using the following four rules (taken from the above Wikipedia article):

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies as if caused by under-population.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The next state is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the current state, where births and deaths occur simultaneously. Given the current state of the `m x n` grid `board`, return *the next state*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid1.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[1,0,1],[0,1,1],[0,1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/26/grid2.jpg)

```
Input: board = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [[1,1],[1,1]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 25`
- `board[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve it in-place? Remember that the board needs to be updated simultaneously: You cannot update some cells first and then use their updated values to update other cells.
- In this question, we represent the board using a 2D array. In principle, the board is infinite, which would cause problems when the active area encroaches upon the border of the array (i.e., live cells reach the border). How would you address these problems?
**My Solution:**
```
void gameOfLife(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        vector<vector<int>> tmp(2, vector<int> (board[0].size()));
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < board.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < board[i].size(); j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                index = i % 2;
                if (i > 0) {
                    sum += board[i - 1][j];
                }
                if (i < board.size() - 1) {
                    sum += board[i + 1][j];
                }
                if (j > 0) {
                    sum += board[i][j - 1];
                }
                if (j < board[i].size() - 1) {
                    sum += board[i][j + 1];
                }
                if (i > 0 && j > 0) {
                    sum += board[i - 1][j - 1];
                }
                if (i > 0 && j < board[i].size() - 1) {
                    sum += board[i - 1][j + 1];
                }
                if (i < board.size() - 1 && j > 0) {
                    sum += board[i + 1][j - 1];
                }
                if (i < board.size() - 1 && j < board[i].size() - 1) {
                    sum += board[i + 1][j + 1];
                }
                if (board[i][j]) {
                    if (sum < 2) {
                        tmp[index][j] = 0;
                    }
                    else if (sum == 2 || sum == 3) {
                        tmp[index][j] = 1;
                    }
                    else {
                        tmp[index][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
                else {
                    if (sum == 3) {
                        tmp[index][j] = 1;
                    }
                    else {
                        tmp[index][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
            if (i > 0) {
                board[i - 1] = tmp[(i - 1) % 2];
            }
        }
        board[board.size() - 1] = tmp[index];
    }
```
Correctness:

Since all the elements should check the 8 neighbours around itself, we should save the original values of their neighbours. After carefully checking, if we scan from the top of the array, when we meet an element that should be checked all the neighbours, we only need to save the top neighbours of it. And also, since this row should be change, we should use a 2 * n dimension vectors to store the previous row and the current row after changing. After saving the changing of the current array, we can replace the original row (on the top of the current row).

Complexity:

Time: O($n ^ 2$)
Space: O(n)

    }
```
Correctness:

This algorithm is like problem 73 Set Matrix Zeros. Instead of using extra, we change the original value to different values that is our of our original scale, which measn our algorithm will not confused by which elements are updated or not.

Although we save some space, we use one more pass to change the value, which is a waste of time.
