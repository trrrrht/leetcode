**Problem:**
Given an array `arr`. You can choose a set of integers and remove all the occurrences of these integers in the array.

Return *the minimum size of the set* so that **at least** half of the integers of the array are removed.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: Choosing {3,7} will make the new array [5,5,5,2,2] which has size 5 (i.e equal to half of the size of the old array).
Possible sets of size 2 are {3,5},{3,2},{5,2}.
Choosing set {2,7} is not possible as it will make the new array [3,3,3,3,5,5,5] which has size greater than half of the size of the old array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only possible set you can choose is {7}. This will make the new array empty.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,9]
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: arr = [1000,1000,3,7]
Output: 1
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `arr.length` is even.
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

**My Solution:**
```
int minSetSize(vector<int>& arr) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        vector<int> tmp;
        int size = arr.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            umap[arr[i]]++;
        }
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (auto iter = umap.begin(); iter != umap.end(); iter++) {
            tmp.emplace_back((*iter).second);
        }
        sort(tmp.begin(), tmp.end());
        for (int i = tmp.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sum += tmp[i];
            count++;
            if (sum * 1.0 >= size * 1.0 / 2.0) {
                return count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

Delete numbers from the highest frequency to the lowest.

According to the size of the data, we can use bucket sort to reduce the running time to O(n), but it's not a general solution.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
