**Problem:**
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]
Explanation: 
rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 105`

 

**Follow up:**

- Try to come up with as many solutions as you can. There are at least **three** different ways to solve this problem.
- Could you do it in-place with `O(1)` extra space?
**Other Solution 1:**
```
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int size = nums.size();
        k = k % size;
        for (int i = 0; i < size / 2; i++) {
            swap(nums[i], nums[size - 1 - i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < k / 2; i++) {
            swap(nums[i], nums[k - 1 - i]);
        }
        for (int i = k; i < (size + k) / 2; i++) {
            swap(nums[i], nums[size - 1 - (i - k)]);
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

If we rotate the array k times, we'll know the last k elements will be the first k. In that case, we can reverse the array and let the last k elements be the first k. Then, we should adjust the order of the numbers. As we know, reversing can make the original array to the reverse order, so we can reverse them in two subarrays (first k and last size - k elements) to get the correct order for each subarray separately. And then we finish the rotate.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution 2:**
```
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        int terminal = 0;
        int size = nums.size();
        int target = (terminal + k) % size;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (target == terminal) {
                terminal++;
                target = terminal;
            }
            else {
                swap(nums[target], nums[terminal]);
            }
            target = (target + k) % size;
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

Since all the elements should move k steps, we'll know that this array will form at most k circles. For example, when k is 2 and the array is [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11], then after moving the first circle, we can get [9, 3, 1, 7, 5, 11]. In this example, we can say 1, 5 and 9 form the first circle. And then, we can start the next circle from 3, so we get [9, 11, 1, 3, 5, 7], which is the result.

This is based on the fact that all the numbers can divide k and have the remain among 0, 1, 2, ..., k - 1, so if two indices of the array have the same remain, they must be in the same circle.

In that case, we just move elements in their own circle and when we finish k circles(already move n elements), we can get the result.
