**Problem:**
Given a Tic-Tac-Toe board as a string array `board`, return `true` if and only if it is possible to reach this board position during the course of a valid tic-tac-toe game.

The board is a `3 x 3` array that consists of characters `' '`, `'X'`, and `'O'`. The `' '` character represents an empty square.

Here are the rules of Tic-Tac-Toe:

- Players take turns placing characters into empty squares `' '`.
- The first player always places `'X'` characters, while the second player always places `'O'` characters.
- `'X'` and `'O'` characters are always placed into empty squares, never filled ones.
- The game ends when there are three of the same (non-empty) character filling any row, column, or diagonal.
- The game also ends if all squares are non-empty.
- No more moves can be played if the game is over.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe1-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = ["O  ","   ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: The first player always plays "X".
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = ["XOX"," X ","   "]
Output: false
Explanation: Players take turns making moves.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/15/tictactoe4-grid.jpg)

```
Input: board = ["XOX","O O","XOX"]
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 3`
- `board[i].length == 3`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'X'`, `'O'`, or `' '`.
