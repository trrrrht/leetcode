**Problem:**
Given an array `A` of integers, a *ramp* is a tuple `(i, j)` for which `i < j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`. The width of such a ramp is `j - i`.

Find the maximum width of a ramp in `A`. If one doesn't exist, return 0.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [6,0,8,2,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (1, 5): A[1] = 0 and A[5] = 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [9,8,1,0,1,9,4,0,4,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
The maximum width ramp is achieved at (i, j) = (2, 9): A[2] = 1 and A[9] = 1.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 50000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 50000`

 **Other Solution:**
```
int maxWidthRamp(vector<int>& A) {
        int size = A.size();
        vector<int> mins(size);
        mins[0] = A[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
            mins[i] = min(mins[i - 1], A[i]);
        }
        int length = 0;
        for (int i = size - 1, j = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            while (j >= 0 && mins[j] <= A[i]) {
                j--;
            }
            length = max(length, i - j - 1);
        }
        return length;
    }
```

Correctness:

If we scan the array from the end to the start, we should find the number that is smaller than A[i] and the distance between them is the largest. In this case, if we save the min value from the left to the right for each A[i], we can get the distance when we scan the array from the right to the left (when we find the min[j] <= A[i], we can let j decrease to see whether there's more value that is smaller than A[i]). Also, if we do this, we won't leave the possible max length because for A[i], we make j to the furthest index that is smaller than A[i].

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
