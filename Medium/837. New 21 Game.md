**Problem:**
Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game **"21"**.

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `k` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, maxPts]`, where `maxPts` is an integer. Each draw is independent and the outcomes have equal probabilities.

Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `k` **or more points**.

Return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer are considered accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 6, k = 1, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
In 6 out of 10 possibilities, she is at or below 6 points.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 21, k = 17, maxPts = 10
Output: 0.73278
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= n <= 104`
- `1 <= maxPts <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
double new21Game(int n, int k, int maxPts) {
        if (k == 0 || n >= k + maxPts) return 1.0;
        vector<double> dp(n + 1);
        dp[0] = 1.0;
        double Wsum = 1.0, res = 0.0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            dp[i] = Wsum / maxPts;
            if (i < k) Wsum += dp[i]; else res += dp[i];
            if (i - maxPts >= 0) Wsum -= dp[i - maxPts];
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i] represents the probability that we get i at some moment. In this case, 1 - dp[i] is the probability that we skip the point i. 

The dp[i] = sum(last maxPts dp values) / maxpts. And to get the sum of maxPts, we could use sliding window ti reduce the running time.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
