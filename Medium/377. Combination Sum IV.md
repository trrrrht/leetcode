 **Problem:**
Given an array of **distinct** integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return *the number of possible combinations that add up to* `target`.

The test cases are generated so that the answer can fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 7
Explanation:
The possible combination ways are:
(1, 1, 1, 1)
(1, 1, 2)
(1, 2, 1)
(1, 3)
(2, 1, 1)
(2, 2)
(3, 1)
Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [9], target = 3
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `nums` are **unique**.
- `1 <= target <= 1000`

 

**Follow up:** What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to allow negative numbers?
**Other Solution:**
```
int combinationSum4(vector<int>& N, int T) {
        vector<unsigned int> dp(T+1, 0);
        dp[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= T; i++)
            for (int num : N)
                if (num <= i) dp[i] += dp[i-num];
        return dp[T];
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i] represents if the target is i, how many combinations is there
