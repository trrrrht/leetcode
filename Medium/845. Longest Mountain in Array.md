**Problem:**
You may recall that an array `arr` is a **mountain array** if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`

- There exists some index

   

  ```
  i
  ```

   

  (

  0-indexed

  ) with

   

  ```
  0 < i < arr.length - 1
  ```

   

  such that:

  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given an integer array `arr`, return *the length of the longest subarray, which is a mountain*. Return `0` if there is no mountain subarray.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [2,1,4,7,3,2,5]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest mountain is [1,4,7,3,2] which has length 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no mountain.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 104`

 

**Follow up:**

- Can you solve it using only one pass?
- Can you solve it in `O(1)` space?
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestMountain(vector<int> A) {
        int res = 0, up = 0, down = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            if (down && A[i - 1] < A[i] || A[i - 1] == A[i]) up = down = 0;
            up += A[i - 1] < A[i];
            down += A[i - 1] > A[i];
            if (up && down) res = max(res, up + down + 1);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
