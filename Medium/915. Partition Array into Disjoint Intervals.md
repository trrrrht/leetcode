**Problem:**
Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

- Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.
- `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning. It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [5,0,3,8,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 4
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
3. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.
**My Solution:**
```
int partitionDisjoint(vector<int>& A) {
        int size = A.size();
        int leftmax = A[0];
        int rightmin = 10e6 + 1;
        vector<int> rightmins(size);
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (rightmin > A[i]) {
                rightmin = A[i];
            }
            rightmins[i] = rightmin;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
            if (leftmax <= rightmins[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            if (leftmax < A[i]) {
                leftmax = A[i];
            }
        }
        return 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to find rightmin number for each number in this array. And then we scan this array from the start to the end to find the one which is smaller than its rightmin.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
**Other Solution:**
```
int partitionDisjoint(vector<int>& A) {
        int leftmax = A[0], allmax=A[0], leftlen = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<A.size();i++)
        {
            if(A[i]<leftmax)
            {
                leftlen = i;
                leftmax = max(leftmax,allmax);
            }
            allmax = max(allmax,A[i]);
        }
        return leftlen+1;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to find a continuous subarray whose max number is smaller than the smaller number than its right subarray, we should keep tracking the leftmax number and check whether A[i] on the right is smaller than it. If so, we should update the index we should returen and the leftmax(because we may update the global max, they leftmax hasn't been updated).

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
