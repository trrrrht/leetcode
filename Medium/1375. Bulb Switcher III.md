**Problem:**
There is a room with `n` bulbs, numbered from `1` to `n`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment *k* (for *k* from `0` to `n - 1`), we turn on the `light[k]` bulb. A bulb **change color to blue** only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which **all turned on** bulbs **are blue.**

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/29/sample_2_1725.png)

```
Input: light = [2,1,3,5,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: light = [3,2,4,1,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: light = [4,1,2,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]
Output: 3
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == light.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
- `light` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`
**My Solution:**
```
int numTimesAllBlue(vector<int>& light) {
        int maxindex = 0;
        int onlight = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < light.size(); i++) {
            maxindex = max(maxindex, light[i]);
            onlight++;
            if (onlight == maxindex) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

When all the bulbs should be turned on, a subarray of bulbs could be blue. We just have to find the max index bulb we have turned on and count whether the bulbs before it have been turned on.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
