**Problem:**
Given a string `word`, return *the **sum of the number of vowels** (*`'a'`, `'e'`*,* `'i'`*,* `'o'`*, and* `'u'`*)* *in every substring of* `word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous (non-empty) sequence of characters within a string.

**Note:** Due to the large constraints, the answer may not fit in a signed 32-bit integer. Please be careful during the calculations.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "aba", "b", "ba", and "a".
- "b" has 0 vowels in it
- "a", "ab", "ba", and "a" have 1 vowel each
- "aba" has 2 vowels in it
Hence, the total sum of vowels = 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
All possible substrings are: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", and "c".
- "a", "ab", and "abc" have 1 vowel each
- "b", "bc", and "c" have 0 vowels each
Hence, the total sum of vowels = 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word = "ltcd"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no vowels in any substring of "ltcd".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 105`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
long long countVowels(string s) {
        long res = 0, n = s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            if (string("aeiou").find(s[i]) != string::npos)
                res += (i + 1) * (n - i);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use combination to calculate the total number

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
