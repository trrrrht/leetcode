**Problem:**
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a **contiguous subarray** `[numsl, numsl+1, ..., numsr-1, numsr]` of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The subarray [4,3] has the minimal length under the problem constraint.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 4, nums = [1,4,4]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: target = 11, nums = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= target <= 109`
- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`

 

**Follow up:** If you have figured out the `O(n)` solution, try coding another solution of which the time complexity is `O(n log(n))`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minSubArrayLen(int target, vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        int left = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            while (sum >= target) {
                ans = min(ans, i + 1 - left);
                sum -= nums[left++];
            }
        }
        return (ans != INT_MAX) ? ans : 0;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is like problem 1 Two Sum. We should add from the first element to the last one. And if the sum is bigger than target, we should check whether we can minus some elements in the subarray, because all the elements are positive, if the sum is larger than target, we know for this subarray, the only way we can get the min size of it is by substracting elements, so we should decrease the sum by drop the first element in the subarray to decrease the size of the subarray. After the sum is smaller than target again, we should continue add elements.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
