**Problem:**
There is only one character `'A'` on the screen of a notepad. You can perform two operations on this notepad for each step:

- Copy All: You can copy all the characters present on the screen (a partial copy is not allowed).
- Paste: You can paste the characters which are copied last time.

Given an integer `n`, return *the minimum number of operations to get the character* `'A'` *exactly* `n` *times on the screen*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Intitally, we have one character 'A'.
In step 1, we use Copy All operation.
In step 2, we use Paste operation to get 'AA'.
In step 3, we use Paste operation to get 'AAA'.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minSteps(int n) {
        int ans = 0, d = 2;
        while (n > 1) {
            while (n % d == 0) {
                ans += d;
                n /= d;
            }
            d++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

We could break the moves into groups of [CPP][CPPPP][CP]...., and these groups have lengths g1, g2, ...., gn. After parsing the first group, there are g1 As. After parsing the second group, there are g1 * g2 As. Finally, we'll get g1 * g2 * ..... gn As. We could break this group into subgroups to get prime factors, so we just have to find the prime to get the moves

Complexity:

Time: O($n^{0.5}$)
Space: O(1)
