**Problem:**
You are standing at position `0` on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position `target`.

You can make some number of moves `numMoves` so that:

- On each move, you can either go left or right.
- During the `ith` move (starting from `i == 1` to `i == numMoves`), you take `i` steps in the chosen direction.

Given the integer `target`, return *the **minimum** number of moves required (i.e., the minimum* `numMoves`*) to reach the destination*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to -1 (2 steps).
On the 3rd move, we step from -1 to 2 (3 steps).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the 1st move, we step from 0 to 1 (1 step).
On the 2nd move, we step from 1 to 3 (2 steps).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `-109 <= target <= 109`
- `target != 0`
**Other Solution:**
```
int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = abs(target);
        int k = 0;
        while (target > 0)
            target -= ++k;
        return target % 2 == 0 ? k : k + 1 + k%2;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we could move either direction as we want, the sign of target is not important, and we could use abs(target) to simulate the process.

Assume k is the smallest number to make sum = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... k >= target. If s == target, then we use k moves to get the result. If S > target, and S - target is even, we could always find a subset of {1, 2, ..., k} equal to (S - target) / 2 (pigeon hole theory).

If S > target and S - target is odd, we could not do this. However, we could add k + 1 to it and if we get even, we could use k + 1 subset to get the result. If not, we could continue use k + 2.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^{0.5}$)
Space: O(1)
