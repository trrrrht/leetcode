**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `arr`, sort the array by performing a series of **pancake flips**.

In one pancake flip we do the following steps:

- Choose an integer `k` where `1 <= k <= arr.length`.
- Reverse the sub-array `arr[0...k-1]` (**0-indexed**).

For example, if `arr = [3,2,1,4]` and we performed a pancake flip choosing `k = 3`, we reverse the sub-array `[3,2,1]`, so `arr = [1,2,3,4]` after the pancake flip at `k = 3`.

Return *an array of the* `k`*-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort* `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within `10 * arr.length` flips will be judged as correct.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,4,1]
Output: [4,2,4,3]
Explanation: 
We perform 4 pancake flips, with k values 4, 2, 4, and 3.
Starting state: arr = [3, 2, 4, 1]
After 1st flip (k = 4): arr = [1, 4, 2, 3]
After 2nd flip (k = 2): arr = [4, 1, 2, 3]
After 3rd flip (k = 4): arr = [3, 2, 1, 4]
After 4th flip (k = 3): arr = [1, 2, 3, 4], which is sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: []
Explanation: The input is already sorted, so there is no need to flip anything.
Note that other answers, such as [3, 3], would also be accepted.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 100`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= arr.length`
- All integers in `arr` are unique (i.e. `arr` is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `arr.length`).
**Other Solution:**
```
void flip(vector<int> &arr, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= k / 2; i++) {
            swap(arr[i], arr[k - i]);
        }
    }
    
    vector<int> pancakeSort(vector<int>& arr) {
        int k = arr.size();
        vector<int> result;
        while (k > 0) {
            int curmax = 0;
            int index = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                if (curmax < arr[i]) {
                    curmax = arr[i];
                    index = i;
                }
            }
            
            if (index != k - 1) {
                flip(arr, index);
                flip(arr, k - 1);
                result.emplace_back(index + 1);
                result.emplace_back(k);
            }
            k--;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

The intuition is that we should perform this algorithm like bubble sort, that is, we should firstly put the largest at index 0 and let the length of the remain "unsorted" array be k. In this case, after two sort, we can sort the array from the biggest element to the smallest.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
