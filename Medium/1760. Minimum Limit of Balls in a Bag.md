**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums` where the `ith` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.

You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a

   

  positive 

  number of balls.

  - For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.

Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.

Return *the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
- Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
- Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
- Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
Output: 7
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minimumSize(vector<int>& A, int k) {
        int left = 1, right = 1e9;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2, count = 0;
            for (int a : A)
                count += (a - 1) / mid;
            if (count > k)
                left = mid + 1;
            else
                right = mid;
        }
        return left;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use the maximum penality as the boundary of binary search

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
