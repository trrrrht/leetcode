**Problem:**
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed.)

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/03/swap_ex1.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [2,1,4,3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [1]
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
**My Solution:**
```
ListNode* swapPairs(ListNode* head) {
        if (head == NULL || head->next == NULL) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode* result = head->next;
        ListNode* pre = NULL;
        ListNode* cur = head;
        ListNode* next = head->next;
        while (cur != NULL && next != NULL) {
            if (pre != NULL) {
                pre->next = next;
            }
            cur->next = next->next;
            next->next = cur;
            pre = cur;
            cur = cur->next;
            if (cur == NULL) {
                break;
            }
            next = next->next->next->next;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Fake head is very useful in this type of problem. For each two pair of node, we should at least use three node to save the previous node, the current node and the next node to finish the swap.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
