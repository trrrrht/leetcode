**Problem:**
An **n-bit gray code sequence** is a sequence of `2n` integers where:

- Every integer is in the **inclusive** range `[0, 2n - 1]`,
- The first integer is `0`,
- An integer appears **no more than once** in the sequence,
- The binary representation of every pair of **adjacent** integers differs by **exactly one bit**, and
- The binary representation of the **first** and **last** integers differs by **exactly one bit**.

Given an integer `n`, return *any valid **n-bit gray code sequence***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 16`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> grayCode(int n) {
        vector<int> ans(1<<n);
        for (int i=0; i<(1<<n); i++) 
            ans[i] = i^(i>>1);
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

Let's denote i ^ (i>>1) as f(i). We could see f(0) = 0. And f(i) ^ f(i+1) = i ^ (i>>1) ^ (i+1) ^ ((i+1)>>1) = (i ^ (i+1)) ^ ((i^(i+1)) >> 1). If we let g(i) = i ^ (i+1), g(i) has the form of 0000111...111, so f(i) ^ f(i+1) = g(i) ^ g(i) >> 1 = 0000100...000, which means f(i) and f(i+1) only differs in one digit. Also, we can see that f(i) = f(j) only if i = j. In this case, if we iterate $2^n$ times, we could get all the gray codes in the correct order

Complexity:

Time: O($2^n$)
Space: O($2^n$)
