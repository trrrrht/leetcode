**Problem:**
Given two arrays `A` and `B` of equal size, the *advantage of `A` with respect to `B`* is the number of indices `i` for which `A[i] > B[i]`.

Return **any** permutation of `A` that maximizes its advantage with respect to `B`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = [2,7,11,15], B = [1,10,4,11]
Output: [2,11,7,15]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = [12,24,8,32], B = [13,25,32,11]
Output: [24,32,8,12]
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length = B.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^9`
3. `0 <= B[i] <= 10^9`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> advantageCount(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B)
    {
        multiset Avals(A.begin(), A.end());
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto b : B)
        {
            auto i = Avals.upper_bound(b);
            res.push_back(Avals.extract(i != Avals.end() ? i : Avals.begin()).value());
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can use balanced tree to find the smallest A that is larger than current B. If we can not find such an A, we know we should put the first used A in the sorted A.

Also, we can sort A and B(remember the index), and check from the start to end. If A is larger than B, put it in the result. Otherwise, put it into remaining array. After all the check, we put them togerther according to the index.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
