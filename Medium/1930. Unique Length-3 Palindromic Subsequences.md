**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, return *the number of **unique palindromes of length three** that are a **subsequence** of* `s`.

Note that even if there are multiple ways to obtain the same subsequence, it is still only counted **once**.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aabca"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "aba" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aaa" (subsequence of "aabca")
- "aca" (subsequence of "aabca")
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "adc"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no palindromic subsequences of length 3 in "adc".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bbcbaba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 palindromic subsequences of length 3 are:
- "bbb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bcb" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "bab" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
- "aba" (subsequence of "bbcbaba")
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int countPalindromicSubsequence(string s) {
        int first[26] = {[0 ... 25] = INT_MAX}, last[26] = {}, res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            first[s[i] - 'a'] = min(first[s[i] - 'a'], i);
            last[s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
            if (first[i] < last[i])
                res += unordered_set<char>(begin(s) + first[i] + 1, begin(s) + last[i]).size();
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Find the first and last same char and count the different chars between them

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
