**Problem:**
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the most frequent **subtree sum**. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

The **subtree sum** of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [5,2,-3]
Output: [2,-3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/freq2-tree.jpg)

```
Input: root = [5,2,-5]
Output: [2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
**Other Solution:**
```
unordered_map<int, int> count;
    int maxCount = 0;
    vector<int> findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode* root) {
        dfs(root);
        vector<int> res;
        for (auto & e: count)
            if (e.second == maxCount)
                res.push_back(e.first);
        return res;
    }


    int dfs(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return 0;
        int s = dfs(root->left) + dfs(root->right) + root->val;
        maxCount = max(maxCount, ++count[s]);
        return s;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just search from the bottom of the tree.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
