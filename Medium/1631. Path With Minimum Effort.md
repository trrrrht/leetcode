**Problem:**
You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. You are given `heights`, a 2D array of size `rows x columns`, where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You are situated in the top-left cell, `(0, 0)`, and you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, `(rows-1, columns-1)` (i.e., **0-indexed**). You can move **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum **effort**.

A route's **effort** is the **maximum absolute difference** in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.

Return *the minimum **effort** required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,2],[3,8,2],[5,3,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The route of [1,3,5,3,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 2 in consecutive cells.
This is better than the route of [1,2,2,2,5], where the maximum absolute difference is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex2.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,3],[3,8,4],[5,3,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The route of [1,2,3,4,5] has a maximum absolute difference of 1 in consecutive cells, which is better than route [1,3,5,3,5].
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/04/ex3.png)

```
Input: heights = [[1,2,1,1,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,2,1,2,1],[1,1,1,2,1]]
Output: 0
Explanation: This route does not require any effort.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `rows == heights.length`
- `columns == heights[i].length`
- `1 <= rows, columns <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i][j] <= 106`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minimumEffortPath(vector<vector<int>> &heights) {
    int m = heights.size(), n = heights[0].size();
    int dirs[5] = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};

    std::vector<vector<int>> efforts(m, vector<int>(n, INT_MAX));
    priority_queue<pair<int, int>, vector<pair<int, int>>, greater<pair<int, int>>> pq;

    pq.emplace(0, 0); 
    while (!pq.empty()) {
      int effort = pq.top().first;
      int x = pq.top().second / 100, y = pq.top().second % 100;
      pq.pop();

      if (x == m - 1 && y == n - 1) return effort;
      if (effort >= efforts[x][y]) continue;
      efforts[x][y] = effort;

      for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
        int nx = x + dirs[i], ny = y + dirs[i + 1];
        if (nx < 0 || nx >= m || ny < 0 || ny >= n) continue;
        int n_effort = max(effort, abs(heights[x][y] - heights[nx][ny]));
        pq.emplace(n_effort, nx * 100 + ny);
      }
    }
    return -1;
  }
```
Correctness:

Each time we want to find the next step, we should get the minimum step position we have visited and check the celss around it

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
