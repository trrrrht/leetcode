**Problem:**
You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of `time[i]` seconds.

Return *the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by* `60`. Formally, we want the number of indices `i`, `j` such that `i < j` with `(time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: time = [30,20,150,100,40]
Output: 3
Explanation: Three pairs have a total duration divisible by 60:
(time[0] = 30, time[2] = 150): total duration 180
(time[1] = 20, time[3] = 100): total duration 120
(time[1] = 20, time[4] = 40): total duration 60
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: time = [60,60,60]
Output: 3
Explanation: All three pairs have a total duration of 120, which is divisible by 60.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 104`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

**My Solution:**
```
int numPairsDivisibleBy60(vector<int>& time) {
        vector<int> rs(60, 0);
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < time.size(); i++) {
            int r = time[i] % 60;
            rs[r]++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < 30; i++) {
            count += rs[i] * rs[60 - i];
        }
        count += (rs[0] * (rs[0] - 1)) / 2;
        count += (rs[30] * (rs[30] - 1)) / 2;
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to find the pairs of total durations divisible by 60, we can use an array to store the remain of each number dividing 60. In this case, if we combine two numbers whose remains can be added up to 60, the sum of them can be divided by 60.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
