**Problem:**
There is a long table with a line of plates and candles arranged on top of it. You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` consisting of characters `'*'` and `'|'` only, where a `'*'` represents a **plate** and a `'|'` represents a **candle**.

You are also given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [lefti, righti]` denotes the **substring** `s[lefti...righti]` (**inclusive**). For each query, you need to find the **number** of plates **between candles** that are **in the substring**. A plate is considered **between candles** if there is at least one candle to its left **and** at least one candle to its right **in the substring**.

- For example, `s = "||**||**|*"`, and a query `[3, 8]` denotes the substring `"*||***\***|"`. The number of plates between candles in this substring is `2`, as each of the two plates has at least one candle **in the substring** to its left **and** right.

Return *an integer array* `answer` *where* `answer[i]` *is the answer to the* `ith` *query*.

 

**Example 1:**

![ex-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-1.png)

```
Input: s = "**|**|***|", queries = [[2,5],[5,9]]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has two plates between candles.
- queries[1] has three plates between candles.
```

**Example 2:**

![ex-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/10/04/ex-2.png)

```
Input: s = "***|**|*****|**||**|*", queries = [[1,17],[4,5],[14,17],[5,11],[15,16]]
Output: [9,0,0,0,0]
Explanation:
- queries[0] has nine plates between candles.
- The other queries have zero plates between candles.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters.
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= lefti <= righti < s.length`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> platesBetweenCandles(string s, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        vector<int> A, res;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
            if (s[i] == '|')
                A.push_back(i);
        for (int q = 0; q < queries.size(); ++q) {
            int i = lower_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), queries[q][0]) - A.begin();
            int j = upper_bound(A.begin(), A.end(), queries[q][1]) - A.begin() - 1;
            res.push_back(i < j ? (A[j] - A[i]) - (j - i) : 0);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use binary seach to find the first plate and last plate between each query, then use pre-sum to get the number of candles

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
