**Problem:**
You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to **any lowercase letter**.

Your goal is to satisfy **one** of the following three conditions:

- **Every** letter in `a` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `b` in the alphabet.
- **Every** letter in `b` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `a` in the alphabet.
- **Both** `a` and `b` consist of **only one** distinct letter.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to achieve your goal.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
Output: 2
Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
Output: 3
Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`
- `a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minCharacters(string a, string b) {
        int m = a.size(), n = b.size(), res = m + n;
        vector<int> c1(26), c2(26);
        for (char& c: a) c1[c - 'a']++;
        for (char& c: b) c2[c - 'a']++;

        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            res = min(res, m + n - c1[i] - c2[i]);
            if (i > 0) {
                c1[i] += c1[i - 1];
                c2[i] += c2[i - 1];
            }
            if (i < 25) {
                res = min(res, m - c1[i] + c2[i]);
                res = min(res, n - c2[i] + c1[i]);
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


Count the frequcy of each character in a and b.
Find the most common characters most_common = max((c1 + c2).values()),
this help meet the condition 3 with m + n - most_common.The we calculate the accumulate prefix sum of count.
This help finding the number of smaller characters in O(1) time.Enumerate the character i a,b,c...x,y,
To meet condition 1,
which is a < b,
we need (m - c1[i]) + c2[i]To meet condition 2,
which is a > b,
we need n - c2[i] + c1[i]

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
