**Problem:**
You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`.

You have to find **two non-overlapping sub-arrays** of `arr` each with a sum equal `target`. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is **minimum**.

Return *the minimum sum of the lengths* of the two required sub-arrays, or return `-1` if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum = 3 ([3] and [3]). The sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have three non-overlapping sub-arrays of sum = 7 ([7], [3,4] and [7]), but we will choose the first and third sub-arrays as the sum of their lengths is 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum = 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= target <= 108`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minSumOfLengths(vector<int>& arr, int target) {
        int sum = 0, n = arr.size(), ans = INT_MAX, len = INT_MAX;
        vector<int> min_len(n, INT_MAX);
        int start = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            sum += arr[end];
            while (sum > target) {
                sum -= arr[start];
                start++;
            }
            if (sum == target) {
                int curLen = end - start + 1;
                if (start > 0 && min_len[start-1] != INT_MAX) {
                    ans = min(ans, curLen + min_len[start-1]);
                }
                len = min(curLen, len); 
            }
            min_len[end] = len;
        }
        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use two pointers to find the boundary

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
