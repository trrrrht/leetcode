**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, find two **disjoint palindromic subsequences** of `s` such that the **product** of their lengths is **maximized**. The two subsequences are **disjoint** if they do not both pick a character at the same index.

Return *the **maximum** possible **product** of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences*.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

 

**Example 1:**

![example-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/24/two-palindromic-subsequences.png)

```
Input: s = "leetcodecom"
Output: 9
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bb"
Output: 1
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
Output: 25
Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 12`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
**Other Solution:**
```
int palSize(string &s, int mask) {
        int p1 = 0, p2 = s.size(), res = 0;
        while (p1 <= p2) {
            if ((mask & (1 << p1)) == 0)
                ++p1;
            else if ((mask & (1 << p2)) == 0)
                --p2;
            else if (s[p1] != s[p2])
                return 0;
            else
                res += 1 + (p1++ != p2--);
        }
        return res;
    }
    int maxProduct(string s) {
        int dp[4096] = {}, res = 0, mask = (1 << s.size()) - 1;
        for (int m = 1; m <= mask; ++m)
            dp[m] = palSize(s, m);
        for (int m1 = mask; m1; --m1)
            if (dp[m1] * (s.size() - dp[m1]) > res)
                for(int m2 = mask ^ m1; m2; m2 = (m2 - 1) & (mask ^ m1))
                    res = max(res, dp[m1] * dp[m2]);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

We have 2^n possible palindromes, and each of them can be represented by a mask [1 ... 4096] (since n is limited to 12).First, we check if a mask represents a valid palindrome, and if so, store the length (or, number of 1 bits) in dp.Then, we check all non-zero masks m1 against all non-intersecting masks m2 (m1 & m2 == 0), and track the largest product.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
