**Problem:**
On an **8x8** chessboard, there can be multiple Black Queens and one White King.

Given an array of integer coordinates `queens` that represents the positions of the Black Queens, and a pair of coordinates `king` that represent the position of the White King, return the coordinates of all the queens (in any order) that can attack the King.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: queens = [[0,1],[1,0],[4,0],[0,4],[3,3],[2,4]], king = [0,0]
Output: [[0,1],[1,0],[3,3]]
Explanation:  
The queen at [0,1] can attack the king cause they're in the same row. 
The queen at [1,0] can attack the king cause they're in the same column. 
The queen at [3,3] can attack the king cause they're in the same diagnal. 
The queen at [0,4] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [0,1]. 
The queen at [4,0] can't attack the king cause it's blocked by the queen at [1,0]. 
The queen at [2,4] can't attack the king cause it's not in the same row/column/diagnal as the king.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/01/untitled-diagram-1.jpg)**

```
Input: queens = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,4],[3,5],[4,4],[4,5]], king = [3,3]
Output: [[2,2],[3,4],[4,4]]
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/10/01/untitled-diagram-2.jpg)**

```
Input: queens = [[5,6],[7,7],[2,1],[0,7],[1,6],[5,1],[3,7],[0,3],[4,0],[1,2],[6,3],[5,0],[0,4],[2,2],[1,1],[6,4],[5,4],[0,0],[2,6],[4,5],[5,2],[1,4],[7,5],[2,3],[0,5],[4,2],[1,0],[2,7],[0,1],[4,6],[6,1],[0,6],[4,3],[1,7]], king = [3,4]
Output: [[2,3],[1,4],[1,6],[3,7],[4,3],[5,4],[4,5]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= queens.length <= 63`
- `queens[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= queens[i][j] < 8`
- `king.length == 2`
- `0 <= king[0], king[1] < 8`
- At most one piece is allowed in a cell.
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> attack(vector<int> king, int row, int column, MySet s) {
        while (king[0] >= 0 && king[0] < 8 && king[1] >= 0 && king[1] < 8) {
            king[0] += row;
            king[1] += column;
            if (s.find(king) != s.end()) {
                return king;
            }
        }
        return {};
    }
    
    vector<vector<int>> queensAttacktheKing(vector<vector<int>>& queens, vector<int>& king) {
        MySet s;
        vector<vector<int>> direction = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, 1}};
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        for (int i = 0; i < queens.size(); i++) {
            s.insert(queens[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < direction.size(); i++) {
            vector<int> result = attack(king, direction[i][0], direction[i][1], s);
            if (result.size()) {
                results.emplace_back(result);
            }
        }
        return results;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to search from the king's eight directions to find the first queen there.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
