**Problem:**
Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in **any order** the folders after removing.

If a `folder[i]` is located within another `folder[j]`, it is called a sub-folder of it.

The format of a path is one or more concatenated strings of the form: `/` followed by one or more lowercase English letters. For example, `/leetcode` and `/leetcode/problems` are valid paths while an empty string and `/` are not.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/" is a subfolder of "/a" and "/c/d/e" is inside of folder "/c/d" in our filesystem.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d/" will be removed because they are subfolders of "/a".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: folder = ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a/b/c","/a/b/ca","/a/b/d"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and '/'
- `folder[i]` always starts with character '/'
- Each folder name is unique.
**My Solution:**
```
bool substr(string a, string b) {
        int i = 0;
        while (i < a.size()) {
            if (a[i] != b[i]) {
                return false;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    vector<string> removeSubfolders(vector<string>& folder) {
        sort(folder.begin(), folder.end());
        vector<string> result;
        string cur = folder[0];
        result.emplace_back(cur);
        cur += "/";
        for (int i = 1; i < folder.size(); i++) {
            if (!substr(cur, folder[i])) {
                cur = folder[i];
                result.emplace_back(cur);
                cur += "/";
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

First, we can sort the array in order to rearrange all the folder tree together (folder and its sub-folder are in order). After that we just have to check each folder whether its a sub-folder.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
