**Problem:**
Given a string `expression` representing an expression of fraction addition and subtraction, return the calculation result in string format.

The final result should be an [irreducible fraction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreducible_fraction). If your final result is an integer, say `2`, you need to change it to the format of a fraction that has a denominator `1`. So in this case, `2` should be converted to `2/1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: expression = "1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: expression = "5/3+1/3"
Output: "2/1"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The input string only contains `'0'` to `'9'`, `'/'`, `'+'` and `'-'`. So does the output.
- Each fraction (input and output) has the format `Â±numerator/denominator`. If the first input fraction or the output is positive, then `'+'` will be omitted.
- The input only contains valid **irreducible fractions**, where the **numerator** and **denominator** of each fraction will always be in the range `[1, 10]`. If the denominator is `1`, it means this fraction is actually an integer in a fraction format defined above.
- The number of given fractions will be in the range `[1, 10]`.
- The numerator and denominator of the **final result** are guaranteed to be valid and in the range of **32-bit** int.
**Other Solution:**
```
string fractionAddition(string expression) {
        istringstream in(expression);
        int A = 0, B = 1, a, b;
        char _;
        while (in >> a >> _ >> b) {
            A = A * b + a * B;
            B *= b;
            int g = abs(__gcd(A, B));
            A /= g;
            B /= g;
        }
        return to_string(A) + '/' + to_string(B);
    }
```
Correctness:

For each fraction, we just have to add them to 0 / 1 and continue the process to get the ultimate result. During each addition, we should get the simplest result

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
