**Problem:**

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],

Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```

**Solution:**

My solution for this problem is using a remember digit to detect whether we have more than 2 duplicates, if so, we move to next index, otherwise, we set this digit to zero and restart counting.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        int t = 0;
        int num = -2231321;
        int total = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (nums[i] != num) {
                num = nums[i];
                nums[t++] = nums[i];
                total = 0;
            }
            else {
                total++;
                if (total < 2) {
                    num = nums[i];
                    nums[t++] = nums[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return t;
    }
};
```

By looking others' solution, I find that I can just look whether nums[i] == nums[i - 1] && nums[i] == num[i - 2] to decide removing this value or not.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
   int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        size_t p = 2;
        
        if (nums.size() < p)
            return nums.size();

        for (size_t i = p; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[p - 1] && nums[i] == nums[p - 2])
                continue;
            else
                nums[p++] = nums[i];
        }

        nums.resize(p);

        return nums.size();
    }
};
```

And an interesting way is to iterate every elements to check whether nums[i] is bigger than the nums[i - 2], if so, we could save it, otherwise removing it.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        int i = 0;
        for (auto e : nums) {
            if (i < 2 || e > nums[i - 2])
                nums[i++] = e;
        }
        return i;
    }
};
```
