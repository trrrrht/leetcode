**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest **non-empty** subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements of this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `0 <= limit <= 109`

**Other Solution:**
```
int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums, int limit) {
        deque<int> max;
        deque<int> min;
        int i = 0;
        int j;
        for(j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++){
            while(!max.empty() && nums[j] > max.back()) max.pop_back();
            while(!min.empty() && nums[j] < min.back()) min.pop_back();
            min.push_back(nums[j]);
            max.push_back(nums[j]);
            if(max.front() - min.front() > limit){
                if(max.front() == nums[i])
                    max.pop_front();
                if(min.front() == nums[i])
                    min.pop_front();
                i++;
            }
        }
        return j - i;
    }
```
Correctness:

If we want to calculate the longest subarray whose maximum absolute difference is less than or equal to limit, we can save the max and min array for current number. For each number nums[j], we should find the max and min number before it (including it). And the index of the min or max is i, so the window size must be j - i. At this time, we should calculate the absolute difference and compare it with limit. If the difference is larger than the limit, we know for the current i, we can not increase the size of the subarray by increasing j, so we should increase i instead. In this case, for each j, we can see the window size is either growing or maintaining, so we just have to scan from start to the end and return j - i
