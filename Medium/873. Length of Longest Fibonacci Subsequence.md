**Problem:**
A sequence `X1, X2, ..., Xn` is *Fibonacci-like* if:

- `n >= 3`
- `Xi + Xi+1 = Xi+2` for all `i + 2 <= n`

Given a **strictly increasing** array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, return the **length** of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

*A subsequence is derived from another sequence `arr` by deleting any number of elements (including none) from `arr`, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3, 5, 8]` is a subsequence of `[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i] < arr[i + 1] <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int lenLongestFibSubseq(vector<int>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
        unordered_map<int, int> index;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            index[arr[i]] = i;
        }
        unordered_map<int, int> longest;
        int result = 0;
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                if (arr[k] - arr[j] < arr[j] && index.find(arr[k] - arr[j]) != index.end()) {
                    int i = index[arr[k] - arr[j]];
                    longest[j * n + k] = longest[i * n + j] + 1;
                    result = max(result, longest[j * n + k] + 2);
                }
            }
        }
        return result >= 3 ? result: 0;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can use longest[j * n + k] to replace longest[j][k] inorder to save space, and it represents When the largest number is nums[k] and the second largest number is nums[j], the length of the fibonacci sequence. In this case, If we scan the array, we can first remember every number in a map to find it quickly. And then we should check all the combination j and k to find the smallest number in the map (or find the biggest number in the map) which satisfies the requirement. Finally we can update the length according to the pre-status.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
