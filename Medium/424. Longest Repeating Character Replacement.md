**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return *the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only uppercase English letters.
- `0 <= k <= s.length`
**Other Solution:**
```
int characterReplacement(string s, int k) {
        int maxf = 0, i = 0, n = s.length();
        vector<int> count(26);
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            maxf = max(maxf, ++count[s[j] - 'A']);
            if (j - i + 1 > maxf + k)
                --count[s[i++] - 'A'];
        }
        return n - i;
    }
```
Correctness:

maxf is the max frequency of the same character in the sliding window

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
