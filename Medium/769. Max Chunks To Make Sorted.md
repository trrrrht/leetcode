**Problem:**
Given an array `arr` that is a permutation of `[0, 1, ..., arr.length - 1]`, we split the array into some number of "chunks" (partitions), and individually sort each chunk. After concatenating them, the result equals the sorted array.

What is the most number of chunks we could have made?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Splitting into two or more chunks will not return the required result.
For example, splitting into [4, 3], [2, 1, 0] will result in [3, 4, 0, 1, 2], which isn't sorted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,0,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We can split into two chunks, such as [1, 0], [2, 3, 4].
However, splitting into [1, 0], [2], [3], [4] is the highest number of chunks possible.
```
**My Solution:**
```
int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> minright(arr.size());
        minright[arr.size() - 1] = arr[arr.size() - 1];
        for (int i = arr.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            minright[i] = min(minright[i + 1], arr[i]);
        }
        int maxnum = arr[0];
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size() - 1; i++) {
            if (maxnum <= minright[i + 1]) {
                result++;
            }
            maxnum = max(maxnum, arr[i + 1]);
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

This problem can be solved by the same algorithm of problem 768 Max Chunks To Make Sorted II.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxChunksToSorted(vector<int>& arr) {
        int result = 0;
        int maxnum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            maxnum = max(maxnum, arr[i]);
            if (maxnum == i) {
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Also, since the numbers of the array is in the range of [0, size - 1], we can know the numbers in sorted array must match its indices. In this case, we don't have to save all the right min number to see whether the current max is smaller than it. We just have to save the current max and check whether we reach the index it belongs. After that, we can add one to result and update current max.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
