**Problem:**
There are `n` people, each person has a unique *id* between `0` and `n-1`. Given the arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends`, where `watchedVideos[i]` and `friends[i]` contain the list of watched videos and the list of friends respectively for the person with `id = i`.

Level **1** of videos are all watched videos by your friends, level **2** of videos are all watched videos by the friends of your friends and so on. In general, the level `k` of videos are all watched videos by people with the shortest path **exactly** equal to `k` with you. Given your `id` and the `level` of videos, return the list of videos ordered by their frequencies (increasing). For videos with the same frequency order them alphabetically from least to greatest. 

 

**Example 1:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/leetcode_friends_1.png)**

```
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 1
Output: ["B","C"] 
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and your friends are (yellow color in the figure):
Person with id = 1 -> watchedVideos = ["C"] 
Person with id = 2 -> watchedVideos = ["B","C"] 
The frequencies of watchedVideos by your friends are: 
B -> 1 
C -> 2
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/leetcode_friends_2.png)**

```
Input: watchedVideos = [["A","B"],["C"],["B","C"],["D"]], friends = [[1,2],[0,3],[0,3],[1,2]], id = 0, level = 2
Output: ["D"]
Explanation: 
You have id = 0 (green color in the figure) and the only friend of your friends is the person with id = 3 (yellow color in the figure).
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == watchedVideos.length == friends.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= watchedVideos[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= watchedVideos[i][j].length <= 8`
- `0 <= friends[i].length < n`
- `0 <= friends[i][j] < n`
- `0 <= id < n`
- `1 <= level < n`
- if `friends[i]` contains `j`, then `friends[j]` contains `i`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<string> watchedVideosByFriends(vector<vector<string>>& watchedVideos, vector<vector<int>>& friends, int id, int level) {
        unordered_map<string, int> umap1;
        int cur = 0;
        queue<int> q;
        unordered_map<int, int> umap2;
        q.push(id);
        umap2[id] = 0;
        vector<string> result;
        while (!q.empty()) {
            int top = q.front();
            q.pop();
            if (umap2[top] > level) {
                break;
            }
            for (int i = 0; i < friends[top].size(); i++) {
                if (umap2.find(friends[top][i]) == umap2.end()) {
                    umap2[friends[top][i]] = umap2[top] + 1;
                    q.push(friends[top][i]);
                }
            }
            if (umap2[top] == level) {
                for (int i = 0; i < watchedVideos[top].size(); i++) {
                    umap1[watchedVideos[top][i]]++;
                    if (umap1[watchedVideos[top][i]] == 1) {
                        result.emplace_back(watchedVideos[top][i]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        sort(result.begin(), result.end(),
            [&](const auto& s1, const auto& s2)
             {
                 return umap1[s1] < umap1[s2] || (umap1[s1] == umap1[s2] && s1 < s2);
             });
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

We could use DFS to find the level. For each node in this level, we just save the movies they watch and sort

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
