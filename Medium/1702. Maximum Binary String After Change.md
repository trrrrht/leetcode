**Problem:**
You are given a binary string `binary` consisting of only `0`'s or `1`'s. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:

- Operation 1: If the number contains the substring

   

  ```
  "00"
  ```

  , you can replace it with

   

  ```
  "10"
  ```

  .

  - For example, `"00010" -> "10010`"

- Operation 2: If the number contains the substring

   

  ```
  "10"
  ```

  , you can replace it with

   

  ```
  "01"
  ```

  .

  - For example, `"00010" -> "00001"`

*Return the **maximum binary string** you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string `x` is greater than binary string `y` if `x`'s decimal representation is greater than `y`'s decimal representation.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: binary = "000110"
Output: "111011"
Explanation: A valid transformation sequence can be:
"000110" -> "000101" 
"000101" -> "100101" 
"100101" -> "110101" 
"110101" -> "110011" 
"110011" -> "111011"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: binary = "01"
Output: "01"
Explanation: "01" cannot be transformed any further.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= binary.length <= 105`
- `binary` consist of `'0'` and `'1'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
string maximumBinaryString(string s) {
        int ones = 0, zeros = 0, n = s.length();
        for (auto& c : s) {
            if (c == '0')
                zeros++;
            else if (zeros == 0)
                ones++;
            c = '1';
        }
        if (ones < n)
            s[ones + zeros - 1] = '0';
        return s;
    }
```
Correctness:

We don't need touch the starting 1s, they are already good.For the rest part,
we continually take operation 2,
making the string like 00...00011...11Then we continually take operation 1,
making the string like 11...11011...11.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
