**Problem:**
Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 104`

**My Solution:**
```
vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<vector<int>> results;
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end(), [](vector<int> a, vector<int> b) {return a[0] < b[0];});
        int minindex = intervals[0][0];
        int maxindex = intervals[0][1];
        for (int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++) {
            if (maxindex < intervals[i][0]) {
                results.emplace_back(vector<int> {minindex, maxindex});
                minindex = intervals[i][0];
                maxindex = intervals[i][1];
            }
            else if (maxindex >= intervals[i][0] && maxindex < intervals[i][1]) {
                maxindex = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }
        results.emplace_back(vector<int> {minindex, maxindex});
        return results;
    }
```
Correctness:

If we don't sort this array by its first element, we have five different situations to discuss and one of them (the later interval is before the current interval and they are not overlap) can not be solved in a good way.

In that case, by sorting the original array, we can reduce the situations to three and we can just discuss relation of the maxindex of current interval with later interval to decide whether they should combine.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)

**Other Solution:**
This problem can be solved by the interval tree, which we'll discuss later in other problem.
