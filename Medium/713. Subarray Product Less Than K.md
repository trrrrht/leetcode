**Problem:**
Your are given an array of positive integers `nums`.

Count and print the number of (contiguous) subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10, 5, 2, 6], k = 100
Output: 8
Explanation: The 8 subarrays that have product less than 100 are: [10], [5], [2], [6], [10, 5], [5, 2], [2, 6], [5, 2, 6].
Note that [10, 5, 2] is not included as the product of 100 is not strictly less than k.
```



**Note:**

`0 < nums.length <= 50000`.

`0 < nums[i] < 1000`.

`0 <= k < 10^6`.
**My Solution:**
```
int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int product = 1;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            product *= nums[i];
            while (product >= k) {
                product /= nums[j++];
            }
            count += i - j + 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

This algorithm is like problem 209 Minimum Size Subarray Sum.

By calculating the product of subarray starting from i and ending by j and find the one who is smaller than k, we can get the count.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
