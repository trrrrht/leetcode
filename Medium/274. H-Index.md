**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `ith` paper, return compute the researcher's `h`**-index**.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

If there are several possible values for `h`, the maximum one is taken as the `h`**-index**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively.
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,3,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int hIndex(vector<int>& c) {
        int s = 0, e = c.size() - 1, avg;
        sort(begin(c), end(c));
        while (s <= e) {
            if (c[avg = (e + s) / 2] < c.size() - avg) s = avg + 1;
            else e = avg - 1;
        }
        return c.size() - s;
    }
```
Correctness:

After soring the array, the problem becomes that we should find the maximum citations that equals to the number of papers.

Also, we can use hash table to store the citations and find hindex

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
