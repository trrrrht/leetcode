**Problem:**
Given an `n x n` `matrix` where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, return *the* `kth` *smallest element in the matrix*.

Note that it is the `kth` smallest element **in the sorted order**, not the `kth` **distinct** element.

You must find a solution with a memory complexity better than `O(n2)`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,5,9],[10,11,13],[12,13,15]], k = 8
Output: 13
Explanation: The elements in the matrix are [1,5,9,10,11,12,13,13,15], and the 8th smallest number is 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[-5]], k = 1
Output: -5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `-109 <= matrix[i][j] <= 109`
- All the rows and columns of `matrix` are **guaranteed** to be sorted in **non-decreasing order**.
- `1 <= k <= n2`

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve the problem with a constant memory (i.e., `O(1)` memory complexity)?
- Could you solve the problem in `O(n)` time complexity? The solution may be too advanced for an interview but you may find reading [this paper](http://www.cse.yorku.ca/~andy/pubs/X+Y.pdf) fun.
**Other Solution:**
```
int kthSmallest(vector<vector<int>> &matrix, int k) {
        int m = matrix.size(), n = matrix[0].size(), ans; 
        priority_queue<vector<int>, vector<vector<int>>, greater<>> minHeap;
        for (int r = 0; r < min(m, k); ++r)
            minHeap.push({matrix[r][0], r, 0});

        for (int i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
            auto top = minHeap.top(); minHeap.pop();
            int r = top[1], c = top[2];
            ans = top[0];
            if (c + 1 < n) minHeap.push({matrix[r][c + 1], r, c + 1});
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

First we store all the first elements in each row in a priority queue. Then we check k times the next column element of the row where the current smallest in the queue is and put it in the priority queue.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
