**Problem:**
In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has `n` empty baskets, the `ith` basket is at `position[i]`, Morty has `m` balls and needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the **minimum magnetic force** between any two balls is **maximum**.

Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions `x` and `y` is `|x - y|`.

Given the integer array `position` and the integer `m`. Return *the required force*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/11/q3v1.jpg)

```
Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
Output: 999999999
Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == position.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= position[i] <= 10^9`
- All integers in `position` are **distinct**.
- `2 <= m <= position.length`
**My Solution:**
```
bool magnetic(vector<int> position, int m, int mid) {
        int count = 1;
        int cur = position[0];
        if (count >= m) {
            return true;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < position.size(); i++) {
            if (position[i] - cur < mid) {
                continue;
            }
            else {
                count++;
                cur = position[i];
            }
            if (count >= m) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    int maxDistance(vector<int>& position, int m) {
        int size = position.size();
        if (m > size) {
            return 0;
        }
        sort(position.begin(), position.end());
        int high = position[size - 1];
        int low = -1;
        int result = 0;
        while (high >= low) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (magnetic(position, m, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

The general usage of binary search, that is using it to find the exact force.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
