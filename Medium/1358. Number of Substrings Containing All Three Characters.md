**Problem:**
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

Return the number of substrings containing **at least** one occurrence of all these characters *a*, *b* and *c*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `3 <= s.length <= 5 x 10^4`
- `s` only consists of *a*, *b* or *c* characters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int numberOfSubstrings(string s) {
        int count[3] = {0, 0, 0},res = 0 , i = 0, n = s.length();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            ++count[s[j] - 'a'];
            while (count[0] && count[1] && count[2])
                --count[s[i++] - 'a'];
            res += i;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's like presum. We use count to save the frequency of abc before, and use two pointer to get the number of substrings

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
