**Other Solution:**
You are given two integer arrays `persons` and `times`. In an election, the `ith` vote was cast for `persons[i]` at time `times[i]`.

For each query at a time `t`, find the person that was leading the election at time `t`. Votes cast at time `t` will count towards our query. In the case of a tie, the most recent vote (among tied candidates) wins.

Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class:

- `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `persons` and `times` arrays.
- `int q(int t)` Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t` according to the mentioned rules.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["TopVotedCandidate", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q"]
[[[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]], [3], [12], [25], [15], [24], [8]]
Output
[null, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation
TopVotedCandidate topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate([0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0], [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30]);
topVotedCandidate.q(3); // return 0, At time 3, the votes are [0], and 0 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(12); // return 1, At time 12, the votes are [0,1,1], and 1 is leading.
topVotedCandidate.q(25); // return 1, At time 25, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1], and 1 is leading (as ties go to the most recent vote.)
topVotedCandidate.q(15); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(24); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(8); // return 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= persons.length <= 5000`
- `times.length == persons.length`
- `0 <= persons[i] < persons.length`
- `0 <= times[i] <= 109`
- `times` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.
- `times[0] <= t <= 109`
- At most `104` calls will be made to `q`.
**Other Solution:**
```
class TopVotedCandidate {
public:
    unordered_map<int, int> m;
    vector<int> times;
    TopVotedCandidate(vector<int> persons, vector<int> times) {
        int n = persons.size(), lead = -1;
        this->times = times;
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            lead = ++count[persons[i]] >= count[lead] ? persons[i] : lead;
            m[times[i]] = lead;
        }
    }

    int q(int t) {
        return m[*--upper_bound(times.begin(), times.end(), t)];
    }
};
```
Correctness:

In the order of time, we count the number of votes for each person.Also, we update the current lead of votes for each time point.if (count[person] >= count[lead]) lead = person

Binary search t in times,find out the latest time point no later than t.Return the lead of votes at that time point.


Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(n)
