**Problem:**
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times. 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.
**Other Solution:**
```
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        int low = 0;
        if (high == 0) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        if (nums[high] > nums[low]) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                return nums[mid + 1];
            }
            if (nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]) {
                return nums[mid];
            }
            
            if (nums[mid] > nums[0]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
```
Correctness:

As we can see from the problem, the nums[i] we find must satisfy the two conditions: nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] > nums[i + 1].

In that case, if we meet a number that meets this requirement, we will know this should be the smallest number in the array.

Also, if we want to perform binary search, we should find the way to update low and high. Since we do not have a target to compare with, we should set a target number by ourselves. We can either use nums[0] or nums[size - 1] because the smallest number must in a monotonic array with either of them. For example, if we use nums[0] as the target, when we find nums[mid] > nums[0], we'll know nums[mid] is either the number we want to find or the number before the number we want, so we should increase low. When we find nums[mid] < nums[0], we'll know nums[mid] is either the number we want to find or the number behind the number we want, so we should decrease high. The situation is similar with using nums[size - 1] as target.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
