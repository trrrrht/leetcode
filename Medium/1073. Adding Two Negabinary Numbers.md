Given two numbers `arr1` and `arr2` in base **-2**, return the result of adding them together.

Each number is given in *array format*: as an array of 0s and 1s, from most significant bit to least significant bit. For example, `arr = [1,1,0,1]` represents the number `(-2)^3 + (-2)^2 + (-2)^0 = -3`. A number `arr` in *array, format* is also guaranteed to have no leading zeros: either `arr == [0]` or `arr[0] == 1`.

Return the result of adding `arr1` and `arr2` in the same format: as an array of 0s and 1s with no leading zeros.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: arr1 represents 11, arr2 represents 5, the output represents 16.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr1 = [0], arr2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr1 = [0], arr2 = [1]
Output: [1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
- `arr1[i]` and `arr2[i]` are `0` or `1`
- `arr1` and `arr2` have no leading zeros
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> addNegabinary(vector<int>& A, vector<int>& B) {
        vector<int> res;
        int carry = 0, i = A.size() - 1, j = B.size() - 1;
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry) {
            if (i >= 0) carry += A[i--];
            if (j >= 0) carry += B[j--];
            res.push_back(carry & 1);
            carry = -(carry >> 1);
        }
        while (res.size() > 1 && res.back() == 0)
            res.pop_back();
        reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's like wrting a base 2 addition and then add minus

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
