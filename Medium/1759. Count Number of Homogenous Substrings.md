**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, return *the number of **homogenous** substrings of* `s`*.* Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abbcccaa"
Output: 13
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are listed as below:
"a"   appears 3 times.
"aa"  appears 1 time.
"b"   appears 2 times.
"bb"  appears 1 time.
"c"   appears 3 times.
"cc"  appears 2 times.
"ccc" appears 1 time.
3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "xy"
Output: 2
Explanation: The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "zzzzz"
Output: 15
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of lowercase letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int countHomogenous(string s) {
        int res = 0, cur = 0, count = 0, mod = 1e9 + 7;
        for (int a: s) {
            count = a == cur ? count + 1 : 1;
            cur = a;
            res = (res + count) % mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

When calculate the consequtive same string, there's a equation. For example, "aaaaa", there're 5 "a", 4 "aa", 3 "aaa", 2 "aaaa", 1 "aaaaa"

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
