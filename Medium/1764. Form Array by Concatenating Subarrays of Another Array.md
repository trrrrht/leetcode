**Problem:**
You are given a 2D integer array `groups` of length `n`. You are also given an integer array `nums`.

You are asked if you can choose `n` **disjoint** subarrays from the array `nums` such that the `ith` subarray is equal to `groups[i]` (**0-indexed**), and if `i > 0`, the `(i-1)th` subarray appears **before** the `ith` subarray in `nums` (i.e. the subarrays must be in the same order as `groups`).

Return `true` *if you can do this task, and* `false` *otherwise*.

Note that the subarrays are **disjoint** if and only if there is no index `k` such that `nums[k]` belongs to more than one subarray. A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: groups = [[1,-1,-1],[3,-2,0]], nums = [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: You can choose the 0th subarray as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0] and the 1st one as [1,-1,0,1,-1,-1,3,-2,0].
These subarrays are disjoint as they share no common nums[k] element.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: groups = [[10,-2],[1,2,3,4]], nums = [1,2,3,4,10,-2]
Output: false
Explanation: Note that choosing the subarrays [1,2,3,4,10,-2] and [1,2,3,4,10,-2] is incorrect because they are not in the same order as in groups.
[10,-2] must come before [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: groups = [[1,2,3],[3,4]], nums = [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7]
Output: false
Explanation: Note that choosing the subarrays [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7] and [7,7,1,2,3,4,7,7] is invalid because they are not disjoint.
They share a common elements nums[4] (0-indexed).
```
**Other Solution:**
```
bool canChoose(vector<vector<int>>& groups, vector<int>& nums)
    {
        int numsIndex = 0;
        int groupsIndex = 0;
        while (numsIndex < nums.size() && groupsIndex < groups.size())
        {
            int matchCount = 0;
            while (numsIndex + matchCount < nums.size() &&
                   matchCount < groups[groupsIndex].size() &&
                   nums[numsIndex + matchCount] == groups[groupsIndex][matchCount])
                ++matchCount;
            if (matchCount == groups[groupsIndex].size())
            {
                ++groupsIndex;
                numsIndex += matchCount;
            }
            else
            {
                ++numsIndex;
            }
        }
        
        return groupsIndex == groups.size();
    }
```
Correctness:

For each group in groups, we should check the subarray in nums. If they match with each other, then continue to check with the current index (not from the begining). If they don't match with each other, we should start from the index + 1 (index is the begining of current subarray)

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
