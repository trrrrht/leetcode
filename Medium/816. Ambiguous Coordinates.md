**Problem:**
We had some 2-dimensional coordinates, like `"(1, 3)"` or `"(2, 0.5)"`. Then, we removed all commas, decimal points, and spaces and ended up with the string s.

- For example, `"(1, 3)"` becomes `s = "(13)"` and `"(2, 0.5)"` becomes `s = "(205)"`.

Return *a list of strings representing all possibilities for what our original coordinates could have been*.

Our original representation never had extraneous zeroes, so we never started with numbers like `"00"`, `"0.0"`, `"0.00"`, `"1.0"`, `"001"`, `"00.01"`, or any other number that can be represented with fewer digits. Also, a decimal point within a number never occurs without at least one digit occurring before it, so we never started with numbers like `".1"`.

The final answer list can be returned in any order. All coordinates in the final answer have exactly one space between them (occurring after the comma.)

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "(123)"
Output: ["(1, 2.3)","(1, 23)","(1.2, 3)","(12, 3)"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "(0123)"
Output: ["(0, 1.23)","(0, 12.3)","(0, 123)","(0.1, 2.3)","(0.1, 23)","(0.12, 3)"]
Explanation: 0.0, 00, 0001 or 00.01 are not allowed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(00011)"
Output: ["(0, 0.011)","(0.001, 1)"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `4 <= s.length <= 12`
- `s[0] == '('` and `s[s.length - 1] == ')'`.
- The rest of `s` are digits.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<string> ambiguousCoordinates(string S) {
        int n = S.size();
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 2; ++i) {
            vector<string> A = f(S.substr(1, i)), B = f(S.substr(i + 1, n - 2 - i));
            for (auto & a : A) for (auto & b : B) res.push_back("(" + a + ", " + b + ")");
        }
        return res;
    }
    vector<string> f(string S) {
        int n = S.size();
        if (n == 0 || (n > 1 && S[0] == '0' && S[n - 1] == '0')) return {};
        if (n > 1 && S[0] == '0') return {"0." + S.substr(1)};
        if (n == 1 || S[n - 1] == '0') return {S};
        vector<string> res = {S};
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) res.push_back(S.substr(0, i) + '.' + S.substr(i));
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O($n^3$)
Space: O(1)
