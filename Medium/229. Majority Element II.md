**Problem:**
Given an integer array of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n/3 ⌋` times.

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in O(1) space?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> majorityElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> answer;
        int count1 = 0 , count2 = 0 ;
        int first = 0 , second = 1;
        for(int i =0 ;i < n ;i ++){
            if(nums[i] == first){
                count1++;
            }
            else if (nums[i] == second){
                count2++;
            }
            else if (count1 == 0){
                first = nums[i];
                count1++;
            }
            else if (count2 == 0){
                second = nums[i];
                count2++;
            }else{
                count1--;
                count2--;
            }
        }
        count1 =0 , count2 =0;
        for(int num : nums){
            if(first == num){
                count1++;
            }
            else if (second == num){
                count2++;
            }
        }
        if(count1 > n/3){
            answer.push_back(first);
        }
        if(count2 > n/3){
            answer.push_back(second);
        }
        return answer;
    }
```
Correctness:

The idea is basically the same as problem 169 Majority Element. We can see from the problem that there are at most two candidates being majority elements, so we can see there might be two teams do the same thing as problem 169 but these two teams will not fight with each other.

We should pay attention to the order of "if" function in this algorithm and we should not set the two candidates as same value to aviod they are eventually the same.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
