**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` of **even length** consisting of digits from `0` to `9`, and two integers `a` and `b`.

You can apply either of the following two operations any number of times and in any order on `s`:

- Add `a` to all odd indices of `s` **(0-indexed)**. Digits post `9` are cycled back to `0`. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `a = 5`, `s` becomes `"3951"`.
- Rotate `s` to the right by `b` positions. For example, if `s = "3456"` and `b = 1`, `s` becomes `"6345"`.

Return *the **lexicographically smallest** string you can obtain by applying the above operations any number of times on* `s`.

A string `a` is lexicographically smaller than a string `b` (of the same length) if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`. For example, `"0158"` is lexicographically smaller than `"0190"` because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and `'5'` comes before `'9'`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "5525", a = 9, b = 2
Output: "2050"
Explanation: We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "5525"
Rotate: "2555"
Add:    "2454"
Add:    "2353"
Rotate: "5323"
Add:    "5222"
Add:    "5121"
Rotate: "2151"
Add:    "2050"
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "2050".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "74", a = 5, b = 1
Output: "24"
Explanation: We can apply the following operations:
Start:  "74"
Rotate: "47"
Add:    "42"
Rotate: "24"
There is no way to obtain a string that is lexicographically smaller then "24".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "0011", a = 4, b = 2
Output: "0011"
Explanation: There are no sequence of operations that will give us a lexicographically smaller string than "0011".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s.length` is even.
- `s` consists of digits from `0` to `9` only.
- `1 <= a <= 9`
- `1 <= b <= s.length - 1`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool less(string &s, int i, int j) {
        for (auto k = 0; k < s.size(); ++k) {
            if (s[(k + i) % s.size()] != s[(k + j) % s.size()])
                return s[(k + i) % s.size()] < s[(k + j) % s.size()];
        }
        return false;
    }
    string findLexSmallestString(string s, int a, int b) {
        string res = s;
        bool odd[10] = {};
        while (odd[s[0] - '0'] == false) {
            odd[s[0] - '0'] = true;
            bool even[10] = {};
            while (even[s[1] - '0'] == false) {
                even[s[1] - '0'] = true;
                int best_r = 0;
                vector<bool> rotate(s.size());
                for (int r = b; !rotate[r]; r = (r + b) % s.size()) {
                    rotate[r] = true;
                    if (less(s, r, best_r))
                        best_r = r;
                }
                res = min(res, s.substr(best_r) + s.substr(0, best_r));                
                for (int k = 1; k < s.size(); k += 2)
                    s[k] = '0' + (s[k] - '0' + a) % 10;
            }
            if (b % 2) {
                for (int k = 0; k < s.size(); k += 2)
                    s[k] = '0' + (s[k] - '0' + a) % 10;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

If b is even, we only can modify digits in the even positions (odd will remain odd after the shift). So, we need to inspect up to 10 variations of our string, each shifted up to n times, where n is the size of the string. For each shift, we compare up to n elements.

If b is odd, we need to check up to 100 variations: 10 odd * 10 even, each shifted up to n times.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
