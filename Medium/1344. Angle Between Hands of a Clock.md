**Problem:**
Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the `hour` and the `minute` hand.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 30
Output: 165
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 30
Output: 75
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/26/sample_3_1673.png)**

```
Input: hour = 3, minutes = 15
Output: 7.5
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: hour = 4, minutes = 50
Output: 155
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: hour = 12, minutes = 0
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= hour <= 12`
- `0 <= minutes <= 59`
- Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
**Other Solution:**
```
double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double minute=minutes*6, hr=hour*30+(double)minutes/2, diff=abs(hr-minute);
        return min(diff, 360-diff);
    }
```
