**Problem:**
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array.

Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 2, [1,1,1] contains 3 numbers with value of 1's.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the number in position 4, [0,1,1,1,1,1,0,1] longest subarray with value of 1's is [1,1,1,1,1].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: You must delete one element.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1]
Output: 4
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
**My Solution:**
```
int longestSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        int zero = 0;
        int result = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int j = 0;
        while (i <= j && j < nums.size()) {
            if (nums[j] == 0) {
                zero++;
            }
            if (zero <= 1) {
                result = max(result, j - i);
            }
            else {
                while (zero > 1) {
                    if (nums[i++] == 0) {
                        zero--;
                    }
                }
            }
            j++;
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

By using two pointers, we use i as the start of the all-1 array and j as the end of the all-1 array. We should update and calculate the number of 0 in it. If the number is larger than 1, then we should increase the start to make the number of 0 in the subarray less than or equal to 1. In this case, by deleting one 0 in the subarray, we could get the all-1 array.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
