**Problem:**
You are given a string `s`. We want to partition the string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.

Return *a list of integers representing the size of these parts*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9,7,8]
Explanation:
The partition is "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is a partition so that each letter appears in at most one part.
A partition like "ababcbacadefegde", "hijhklij" is incorrect, because it splits s into less parts.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "eccbbbbdec"
Output: [10]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> partitionLabels(string S) {
      vector<int> res, pos(26, 0);  
      for (auto i = 0; i < S.size(); ++i) pos[S[i] - 'a'] = i;
      for (auto i = 0, idx = INT_MIN, last_i = 0; i < S.size(); ++i) {
        idx = max(idx, pos[S[i] - 'a']);
        if (idx == i) res.push_back(i - exchange(last_i, i + 1) + 1);
      }
      return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

In the first pass, we should record the last position for each letter. In the second pass we should keep the max position of the letters we have seen. If the pointer exceeds the maximum position, we could found the part

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
