**Problem:**
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2), because they are adjacent houses.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
public:
    int rob(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size(); 
        if (n < 2) return n ? nums[0] : 0;
        return max(robber(nums, 0, n - 2), robber(nums, 1, n - 1));
    }
private:
    int robber(vector<int>& nums, int l, int r) {
        int pre = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int i = l; i <= r; i++) {
            int temp = max(pre + nums[i], cur);
            pre = cur;
            cur = temp;
        }
        return cur;
    }
```
Correctness:

Consider this circle as the first house and the last house could not be robbed at the same time, then we decompose this problem to House Robber I

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
