**Problem:**
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `fee` representing a transaction fee.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
Output: 8
Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
- Buying at prices[0] = 1
- Selling at prices[3] = 8
- Buying at prices[4] = 4
- Selling at prices[5] = 9
The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104`
- `0 <= fee < 5 * 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices, int fee) {
        int cash = 0;
        int stock = -prices[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < prices.size(); i++) {
            cash = max(cash, stock + prices[i] - fee);
            stock = max(stock, cash - prices[i]);
        }
        return cash;
    }
```
Correctness:

The intuition of this solution is very simple but hard to think. We can simulate the transaction of the stock. If we hold stock at i + 1 day, the stock is either the one we held at i day or the one we bought at i day (stock = max(stock, cash - prices[i])). If we don't hold stock at i + 1 day, then we either didn't hold stock at i day or sold the stock we had at i day(cash = max(cash, stock + prices[i] - fee)). Since we want our profit to be the highest, we should make cash be the highest.
