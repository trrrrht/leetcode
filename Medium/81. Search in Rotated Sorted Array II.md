**Problem:**
There is an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order (not necessarily with **distinct** values).

Before being passed to your function, `nums` is **rotated** at an unknown pivot index `k` (`0 <= k < nums.length`) such that the resulting array is `[nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]]` (**0-indexed**). For example, `[0,1,2,4,4,4,5,6,6,7]` might be rotated at pivot index `5` and become `[4,5,6,6,7,0,1,2,4,4]`.

Given the array `nums` **after** the rotation and an integer `target`, return `true` *if* `target` *is in* `nums`*, or* `false` *if it is not in* `nums`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
- `nums` is guaranteed to be rotated at some pivot.
- `-104 <= target <= 104`

 

**Follow up:** This problem is the same as [Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/), where `nums` may contain **duplicates**. Would this affect the runtime complexity? How and why?
**My Solution:**
```
bool search(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        int size = nums.size();
        int low = 0;
        int high = size - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            while (low < size - 1 && nums[low] == nums[low + 1]) {
                low++;
            }
            while (high > 0 && nums[high] == nums[high - 1]) {
                high--;
            }
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return true;
            }
            if (nums[mid] < nums[high]) {
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[high]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
                else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            else if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                if (nums[mid] > target && target >= nums[low]) {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
                else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's just like problem 33 Search in Rotated Sorted Array, but in this problem, we should deal with duplicate numbers by using while function to skip them. Otherwise, the array can not maintain monotonic increasing in one part of it, which means the original algorithm may skip the value we want to find.

Complexity:

Space: O(logn)
Time: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
Also, because we can't decide where we should go when nums[mid] == nums[high], we can just decrease high instead of skipping all the duplicate numbers.
