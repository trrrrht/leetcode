**Problem:**
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i`-th character of `s` to `i`-th character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer `maxCost`.

Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of `t`with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

If there is no substring from `s` that can be changed to its corresponding substring from `t`, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= maxCost <= 10^6`
- `s` and `t` only contain lower case English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int equalSubstring(string s, string t, int maxCost) {
        vector<int> costs(s.size());
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            costs[i] = abs(s[i] - t[i]);
        }
        int length = 0;
        int cost = 0;
        int prev = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < costs.size(); i++) {
            cost += costs[i];
            if (cost <= maxCost) {
                length = max(length, i - prev);
            }
            else {
                while (cost > maxCost) {
                    cost -= costs[++prev];
                }
                length = max(length, i - prev);
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
```
Correctness:

We want the longest substring that can be formed within maxCost. In this case, we just have to calculate all the costs first and use sliding window algorithm, that is, if we find sum of the cost of changing current element is no larger than maxCost, we can strengthen the length. Otherwise, we should make the head of the substring closer to the tail until the total cost is no larger than maxCost.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
