**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of `s` and replace a **single character** by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by **exactly** one character.

For example, the underlined substrings in `"computer"` and `"computation"` only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return *the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.*

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aba", t = "baba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
("aba", "baba")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "ab", t = "bb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
("ab", "bb")
The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: 0
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "abe", t = "bbc"
Output: 10
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.
**Other Solution:**
```
int countSubstrings(string s, string t) {
        int res = 0 ;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); ++i)
            res += helper(s, t, i, 0);
        for (int j = 1; j < t.length(); ++j)
            res += helper(s, t, 0, j);
        return res;
    }

    int helper(string s, string t, int i, int j) {
        int res = 0, pre = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int n = s.length(), m = t.length(); i < n && j < m; ++i, ++j) {
            cur++;
            if (s[i] != t[j])
                pre = cur, cur = 0;
            res += pre;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Let each char in s or t be the start of substring to match another one. Since we could at most change one char, we should use cur to indicate the size of substrings in s and t that match with each other. When we meet an index where the chars in s and t don't match with each other, we should clear the buffer(assign cur to pre) and start from 0 again

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
