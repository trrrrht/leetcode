**Problem:**
Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list which contains `n` different positive integers ranging from `1` to `n` and obeys the following requirement:
Suppose this list is [a1, a2, a3, ... , an], then the list [|a1 - a2|, |a2 - a3|, |a3 - a4|, ... , |an-1 - an|] has exactly `k` distinct integers.

If there are multiple answers, print any of them.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]
Explanation: The [1, 2, 3] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [1, 1] has exactly 1 distinct integer: 1.
```



**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2]
Explanation: The [1, 3, 2] has three different positive integers ranging from 1 to 3, and the [2, 1] has exactly 2 distinct integers: 1 and 2.
```



**Note:**

1. The `n` and `k` are in the range 1 <= k < n <= 104.
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> constructArray(int n, int k) {
        vector<int> result(n, 0);
        int count = n;
        for (int i = k, j = 0; i > 0; i -= 2, j++) {
            result[n - i + j] = n;
            n--;
        }
        count = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            if (!result[i]) {
                result[i] = count++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

After carefully checking this problem, I find there's a rule for it. Here are some examples. n = 3, k = 2, the result is [1, 3, 2]. n = 4, k = 2, the result is [1, 2, 4, 3]. n = 5, k = 2, the result is [1, 2, 3, 5, 4]. n = 4, k = 3, the result is [1, 4, 2, 3]. n = 5, k = 3, the result is [1, 2, 5, 3, 4]. n = 5, k = 4, the result is [1, 5, 2, 4, 3].

We can see the rule from these examples. First, we should move the last element x steps according to k. If we move the last element 1 step, we will get one more difference. If we move the last element 2 steps but it doesn't reach index 0, we will get two more differences and that's the most difference can be added by moving just one element, so if k is still larger than that, we should moving the second last element but not let it reaches the position the last one is at now. For example, if n = 9, k = 6, we should process the problem in this way:
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] 1 difference
[1, 9, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] 3 differences
[1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] 5 differences
[1, 9, 2, 8, 3, 4, 5, 7, 6] 6 differences
