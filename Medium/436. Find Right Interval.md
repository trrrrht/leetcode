**Problem:**
You are given an array of `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]` and each `starti` is **unique**.

The **r****ight** **interval** for an interval `i` is an interval `j` such that `startj`` >= endi` and `startj` is **minimized**.

Return *an array of **right interval** indices for each interval `i`*. If no **right interval** exists for interval `i`, then put `-1` at index `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,2]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is only one interval in the collection, so it outputs -1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[3,4],[2,3],[1,2]]
Output: [-1,0,1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start0 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
The right interval for [1,2] is [2,3] since start1 = 2 is the smallest start that is >= end2 = 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]
Output: [-1,2,-1]
Explanation: There is no right interval for [1,4] and [3,4].
The right interval for [2,3] is [3,4] since start2 = 3 is the smallest start that is >= end1 = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 2 * 104`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `-106 <= starti <= endi <= 106`
- The start point of each interval is **unique**.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> findRightInterval(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        vector<int> ans(intervals.size());
        map<int, int> m;
        for(int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++)
            m[intervals[i][0]] = i;
        for(int i = 0; i < intervals.size(); i++) 
               ans[i]  = m.lower_bound(intervals[i][1])!=end(m)?m.lower_bound(intervals[i][1]) -> second:-1;
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each start, use binary search to find the end time that is bigger than it

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
