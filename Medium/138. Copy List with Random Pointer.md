**Problem:**
A linked list of length `n` is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list, or `null`.

Construct a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list. The deep copy should consist of exactly `n` **brand new** nodes, where each new node has its value set to the value of its corresponding original node. Both the `next` and `random` pointer of the new nodes should point to new nodes in the copied list such that the pointers in the original list and copied list represent the same list state. **None of the pointers in the new list should point to nodes in the original list**.

For example, if there are two nodes `X` and `Y` in the original list, where `X.random --> Y`, then for the corresponding two nodes `x` and `y` in the copied list, `x.random --> y`.

Return *the head of the copied linked list*.

The linked list is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

- `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
- `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) that the `random` pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

Your code will **only** be given the `head` of the original linked list.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e1.png)

```
Input: head = [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
Output: [[7,null],[13,0],[11,4],[10,2],[1,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e2.png)

```
Input: head = [[1,1],[2,1]]
Output: [[1,1],[2,1]]
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/12/18/e3.png)**

```
Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
Explanation: The given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000`
- `Node.random` is `null` or is pointing to some node in the linked list.
**Other Solution:**
```
Node* copyRandomList(Node* head) {
        Node *newHead, *l1, *l2;
        if (head == NULL) return NULL;
        for (l1 = head; l1 != NULL; l1 = l1->next->next) {
            l2 = new Node(l1->val);
            l2->next = l1->next;
            l1->next = l2;
        }

        newHead = head->next;
        for (l1 = head; l1 != NULL; l1 = l1->next->next) {
            if (l1->random != NULL) l1->next->random = l1->random->next;
        }

        for (l1 = head; l1 != NULL; l1 = l1->next) {
            l2 = l1->next;
            l1->next = l2->next;
            if (l2->next != NULL) l2->next = l2->next->next;
        }
        return newHead;
    }
```
Correctness:

First, we insert a copy node behind each original node in the chain. In this case, the copy random pointer should be the next pointer of the original random pointer, so we could set the random pointer of the copy one as the next pointer of the original one. Finally, we pick up all the copy node.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
