**Problem:**
A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater** than all of its **adjacent** neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are equal**, find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return *the length 2 array* `[i,j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter** with the value `-1` in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/07/3.png)**

```
Input: mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]
Output: [1,1]
Explanation: Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 105`
- No two adjacent cells are equal.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> findPeakGrid(vector<vector<int>>& mat) {
        int startCol = 0, endCol = mat[0].size()-1;
        
        while(startCol <= endCol){
            int maxRow = 0, midCol = startCol + (endCol-startCol)/2;
            
            for(int row=0; row<mat.size(); row++){
                maxRow = mat[row][midCol] >= mat[maxRow][midCol]? row : maxRow;   
            }
            
            bool leftIsBig    =   midCol-1 >= startCol  &&  mat[maxRow][midCol-1] > mat[maxRow][midCol];
            bool rightIsBig   =   midCol+1 <= endCol    &&  mat[maxRow][midCol+1] > mat[maxRow][midCol];
            
            if(!leftIsBig && !rightIsBig) 
                return vector<int>{ maxRow, midCol};
            
            else if(rightIsBig)
                startCol = midCol+1; 
            
            else 
                endCol = midCol-1;
        }
        return vector<int>{-1,-1};
    }
```
Correctness:

We first use column as the boundary of binary search. And for the column we find now, check every of it to get a max row. After that, we check whether it's a peak cell. If now, we go to the left column or right column depending on the value.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
