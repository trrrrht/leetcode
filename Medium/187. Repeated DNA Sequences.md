**Problem:**
The **DNA sequence** is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, and `'T'`.

- For example, `"ACGAATTCCG"` is a **DNA sequence**.

When studying **DNA**, it is useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.

Given a string `s` that represents a **DNA sequence**, return all the **`10`-letter-long** sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'A'`, `'C'`, `'G'`, or `'T'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<string> findRepeatedDnaSequences(string s) {
        vector<string> result;
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        for (int i = 0, h = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
            h = ((h & 0x07ffffff) << 3) | (s[i] & 7);
            if ((count[h]++) == 1) {
                result.push_back(s.substr(i - 9, 10));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each letter in the DNA sequences, we could use 3-bits to represent it. Since the bits of integer is 32 and we should find 10-letter-long sequences, we could use a integer to represent the subsequence.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
