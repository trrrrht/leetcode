**Problem:**
Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if it is possible to represent* `n` *as the sum of distinct powers of three.* Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3x`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 12
Output: true
Explanation: 12 = 31 + 32
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 91
Output: true
Explanation: 91 = 30 + 32 + 34
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 21
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 107`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        if(n == 1) return true;
        if(n % 3 == 0) return checkPowersOfThree(n / 3);
        if(n % 3 == 1) return checkPowersOfThree ((n - 1) / 3);
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

The question could be represented with base 3

The ony difference here is that all the numbers can be represented in base 2 number system since the remainder is either 0 or 1, but is case of 3, the remainders can be 0,1 or 2. So if at all the remainder is 2, we cannot represent n as sum of power 3.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
