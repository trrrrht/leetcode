**Problem:**
Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles **arranged in a row**, and each pile has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. Initially, `M = 1`.

On each player's turn, that player can take **all the stones** in the **first** `X` remaining piles, where `1 <= X <= 2M`. Then, we set `M = max(M, X)`.

The game continues until all the stones have been taken.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [2,7,9,4,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:  If Alice takes one pile at the beginning, Bob takes two piles, then Alice takes 2 piles again. Alice can get 2 + 4 + 4 = 10 piles in total. If Alice takes two piles at the beginning, then Bob can take all three piles left. In this case, Alice get 2 + 7 = 9 piles in total. So we return 10 since it's larger. 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [1,2,3,4,5,100]
Output: 104
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= piles.length <= 100`
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int stoneGameII(vector<int>& piles) {
        int length = piles.size();
        vector<vector<int>>dp(length + 1, vector<int>(length + 1,0));
        vector<int> sufsum (length + 1, 0);
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            sufsum[i] = sufsum[i + 1] + piles[i];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= length; i++) {
            dp[i][length] = sufsum[i];
        }
        for (int i = length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = length - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
                for (int X = 1; X <= 2 * j && i + X <= length; X++) {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], sufsum[i] - dp[i + X][max(j, X)]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][1];
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i][j] is the maximum number of stones Alex could get when starting at index i with M = j.

sufsum[i] is the total number of stones from index i to the end.

The stragegy for Alex is to choose an optimal X to minimize the number of stones Lee could get when starting at index (i + X) with M = max(X, j)

Complexity:

Time: O($n^3$)
Space: O($n^2$)
