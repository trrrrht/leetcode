**Problem:**
You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`.

You can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., Change the value of the cell from `0` to `1` or vice versa).

Return *the maximum number of rows that have all values equal after some number of flips*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 1
Explanation: After flipping no values, 1 row has all values equal.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first column, both rows have equal values.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: After flipping values in the first two columns, the last two rows have equal values.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `matrix[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxEqualRowsAfterFlips(vector<vector<int>>& M) {
		unordered_map<string, int> map;

		for (auto& r : M) {
			string s(r.size(), 'T');
			for (int i = 1; i < r.size(); i++) {
				if (r[i] != r[0]) s[i] = 'F';
			}
			map[s]++;
		}

		int ans = 0;
		for (auto& p : map)
			ans = max(ans, p.second);
		
		return ans;
	}
```
Correctness:

Since we have to change the matrix according to its columns to make all values in some rows equal, we should find all the rows that are the same. The intuition is that we should change the one whole column at the same time, so if two cells of different rows in a column are different, however we change the matrix, we could not let the values in the two rows each be the same at the same time.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
