**Problem:**
You are given two images `img1` and `img2` both of size `n x n`, represented as binary, square matrices of the same size. (A binary matrix has only 0s and 1s as values.)

We translate one image however we choose (sliding it left, right, up, or down any number of units), and place it on top of the other image. After, the *overlap* of this translation is the number of positions that have a 1 in both images.

(Note also that a translation does **not** include any kind of rotation.)

What is the largest possible overlap?

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/09/overlap1.jpg)

```
Input: img1 = [[1,1,0],[0,1,0],[0,1,0]], img2 = [[0,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
Explanation: We slide img1 to right by 1 unit and down by 1 unit.

The number of positions that have a 1 in both images is 3. (Shown in red)
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: img1 = [[1]], img2 = [[1]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: img1 = [[0]], img2 = [[0]]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == img1.length`
- `n == img1[i].length`
- `n == img2.length`
- `n == img2[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `img1[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
- `img2[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.
**My Solution:**
```
int largestOverlap(vector<vector<int>>& img1, vector<vector<int>>& img2) {
        int n = img1.size();
        int maxcount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int r = 0; r < n - i; r++) {
                    for (int c = 0; c < n - j; c++) {
                        if (img2[r][c] == 1 && img2[r][c] == img1[r + i][c + j]) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxcount = max(maxcount, count);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int r = i; r < n; r++) {
                    for (int c = j; c < n; c++) {
                        if (img2[r][c] == 1 && img2[r][c] == img1[r - i][c - j]) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxcount = max(maxcount, count);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int r = 0; r < n - i; r++) {
                    for (int c = j; c < n; c++) {
                        if (img2[r][c] == 1 && img2[r][c] == img1[r + i][c - j]) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxcount = max(maxcount, count);
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int count = 0;
                for (int r = i; r < n; r++) {
                    for (int c = 0; c < n - j; c++) {
                        if (img2[r][c] == 1 && img2[r][c] == img1[r - i][c + j]) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
                maxcount = max(maxcount, count);
            }
        }
        return maxcount;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to check all the overlap of the direction of movement.

This problem can use imagine convolution algorithm to solve.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^4$)
Space: O(1)
