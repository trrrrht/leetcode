**Problem:**
Some people will make friend requests. The list of their ages is given and `ages[i]` is the age of the ith person. 

Person A will NOT friend request person B (B != A) if any of the following conditions are true:

- `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
- `age[B] > age[A]`
- `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Otherwise, A will friend request B.

Note that if A requests B, B does not necessarily request A. Also, people will not friend request themselves.

How many total friend requests are made?

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [16,16]
Output: 2
Explanation: 2 people friend request each other.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [16,17,18]
Output: 2
Explanation: Friend requests are made 17 -> 16, 18 -> 17.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [20,30,100,110,120]
Output: 3
Explanation: Friend requests are made 110 -> 100, 120 -> 110, 120 -> 100.
```

 

Notes:

- `1 <= ages.length <= 20000`.
- `1 <= ages[i] <= 120`.
**My Solution:**
```
int numFriendRequests(vector<int>& ages) {
        vector<int> accages(121, 0);
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < ages.size(); i++) {
            accages[ages[i]]++;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < 121; i++) {
            accages[i] += accages[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < ages.size(); i++) {
            if (ages[i] < 15) {
                continue;
            } 
            int high = ages[i];
            int low = ages[i] * 0.5 + 7;
            result += accages[high] - accages[low];
            if (ages[i] > low && ages[i] <= high) {
                result--;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

This solution uses the technique called prefix sum. Since we want to find number of all the ages in a certain range [i, j], we can save the number of each age in a map and for age i, we should add the number of i - 1 (in this case, the map of age i stores the total number from age 0 to age i). We can get the result by using map[j] - map[i]. And we should pay attention that a person should not make friends with himself.
