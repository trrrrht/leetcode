**Problem:**
You are given a string s of length `n` containing only four kinds of characters: `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.

A string is said to be **balanced** if each of its characters appears `n / 4` times where `n` is the length of the string.

Return *the minimum length of the substring that can be replaced with **any** other string of the same length to make* `s` ***balanced***. If s is already **balanced**, return `0`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "QWER"
Output: 0
Explanation: s is already balanced.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "QQWE"
Output: 1
Explanation: We need to replace a 'Q' to 'R', so that "RQWE" (or "QRWE") is balanced.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "QQQW"
Output: 2
Explanation: We can replace the first "QQ" to "ER". 
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == s.length`
- `4 <= n <= 105`
- `n` is a multiple of `4`.
- `s` contains only `'Q'`, `'W'`, `'E'`, and `'R'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int balancedString(string s) {
        unordered_map<int, int> count;
        int n = s.length(), res = n, i = 0, k = n / 4;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            count[s[j]]++;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            count[s[j]]--;
            while (i < n && count['Q'] <= k && count['W'] <= k && count['E'] <= k && count['R'] <= k) {
                res = min(res, j - i + 1);
                count[s[i++]] += 1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


One pass the all frequency of "QWER".
Then slide the window in the string s.Imagine that we erase all character inside the window,
as we can modyfy it whatever we want,
and it will always increase the count outside the window.So we can make the whole string balanced,
as long as max(count[Q],count[W],count[E],count[R]) <= n / 4.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
