**Problem:**

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in ascending order, find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

**Follow up:** Could you write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity?

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`
- `nums` is a non-decreasing array.
- `-109 <= target <= 109`

**My Solution:**

```
vector<int> searchRange(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        vector<int> result;
        int size = nums.size();
        int high = size - 1;
        int low = 0;
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            }   
            else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                if (mid == 0 || (mid > 0 && nums[mid - 1] != target)) {
                    result.push_back(mid);
                    break;
                }
                else {
                    high = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        high = size - 1;
        low = 0;
        while(low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > target) {
                high = mid - 1;
            }   
            else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                if (mid == size - 1 || (mid < size - 1 && nums[mid + 1] != target)) {
                    result.push_back(mid);
                    break;
                }
                else {
                    low = mid + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        if (result.size() == 0) {
            result.push_back(-1);
            result.push_back(-1);
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's almost like binary search but with more conditions. Since we may have multiple target numbers in the array and we should find the boundary of them, we should not stop when we find the first one. Instead, we should check whether the first one's left or right is also the target number and decide to continue or not.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
Actually, it's no need to use more conditions to control the movement of indexes, because if we want to find the high boundary, we can continue increase the high index when we meet target number. 

If we meet the last target number and we increase the high index, it will be exactly 1 larger than the high boundary. And if we continue searching, it wouldn't change. In that case, we can returen high index - 1 as the high boundary. It's almost the same when it comes to the low boundary.
