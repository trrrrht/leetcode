**Problem:**
Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are **sorted in ascending order**, convert it to a height balanced BST.

For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [0]
Output: [0]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: head = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2 * 104]`.
- `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
**Other Solution:**
```
TreeNode* sortedListToBST(ListNode* head) {
        if(head == NULL)
            return NULL;
        if(head->next == NULL)
            return new TreeNode(head->val);
        
        ListNode *p=head, *q=head, *pre;
        
        while(q!=NULL && q->next != NULL){
            pre = p;
            p = p->next;
            q = q->next->next;
        }
        pre->next = NULL;
        
        TreeNode *root = new TreeNode(p->val);
        root->right = sortedListToBST(p->next);
        root->left = sortedListToBST(head);
        
        return root;        
    }
```
Correctness:

Each time, we should find the middle node of the list to build the root of sub-BST since the list is sorted. After that, we use recursion to continue to process the rest of the nodes in the list

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
