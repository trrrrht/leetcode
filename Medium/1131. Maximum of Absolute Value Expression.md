**Problem:**
Given two arrays of integers with equal lengths, return the maximum value of:

```
|arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j|
```

where the maximum is taken over all `0 <= i, j < arr1.length`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr1 = [1,2,3,4], arr2 = [-1,4,5,6]
Output: 13
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr1 = [1,-2,-5,0,10], arr2 = [0,-2,-1,-7,-4]
Output: 20
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= arr1.length == arr2.length <= 40000`
- `-10^6 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 10^6`
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxAbsValExpr(vector<int>& x, vector<int>& y) {
        int res = 0, n = x.size(), smallest, cur;
        for (int p : {1, -1}) {
            for (int q : {1, -1}) {
                smallest = p * x[0] + q * y[0] + 0;
                for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                    cur = p * x[i] + q * y[i] + i;
                    res = max(res, cur - smallest);
                    smallest = min(smallest, cur);
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

The equation could be separate into 4 different expressions according to the value of the numbers, so we could let the expression be f(j) - f(i), where f(i) = p * x[i] + q * y[i] + i, p = 1 or -1 and q = 1 or -1.

For 3 points on the place, we have |AO| - |BO| <= |AB|. Each time, for each point B, we could find the smallest A point to O.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
