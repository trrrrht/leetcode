**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `p`, return *an array of all the start indices of* `p`*'s anagrams in* `s`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0,6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 104`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        int letters[26] = {0};
        for(char c : p) letters[c - 'a']++;
        
        vector<int> result;
        int remaining = p.size(), j = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i< s.size(); i++){
            while(j < s.size() && j - i < p.size()){
                if(letters[s.at(j++) - 'a']-- > 0)
                    remaining--;
            }
            if(remaining == 0 && j - i == p.size()) 
                result.push_back(i);
            if(letters[s.at(i) - 'a']++ >= 0) 
                remaining++;            
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use remaining to indicate how many chars we still have to find in the s string. For each char in the s string, we use it as the start of the substring and continue to find the chars after it. If the remaining is 0 and j - i is the size of p string, we could save we find a anagram.
