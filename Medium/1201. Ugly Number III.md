**Problem:**
An **ugly number** is a positive integer that is divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `nth` **ugly number**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
Output: 1999999984
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 109`
- `1 <= a * b * c <= 1018`
- It is guaranteed that the result will be in range `[1, 2 * 109]`.
**Other Solution:**
```
typedef long long ll;
#define MAX_ANS 2e9

class Solution {
public:
    int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        int left = 0, right = MAX_ANS, result = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (count(mid, a, b, c) >= n) { 
                result = mid;
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    int count(ll num, ll a, ll b, ll c) {
        return (int)(num / a + num / b + num / c
            - num / lcm(a, b)
            - num / lcm(b, c)
            - num / lcm(a, c)
            + num / (lcm(a, lcm(b, c))));
    }
    ll gcd(ll a, ll b) {
        if (a == 0) return b;
        return gcd(b % a, a);
    }
    ll lcm(ll a, ll b) {
        return a * b / gcd(a, b);
    }
};
```
Correctness:

Use binary search to find the number that satisfies the requirement. We use Venn graph to get the number that is divisible by a, b, c

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
