**Problem:**
On a social network consisting of `m` users and some friendships between users, two users can communicate with each other if they know a common language.

You are given an integer `n`, an array `languages`, and an array `friendships` where:

- There are `n` languages numbered `1` through `n`,
- `languages[i]` is the set of languages the `ith` user knows, and
- `friendships[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes a friendship between the users `ui` and `vi`.

You can choose **one** language and teach it to some users so that all friends can communicate with each other. Return *the* ***minimum*** *number of users you need to teach.*

Note that friendships are not transitive, meaning if `x` is a friend of `y` and `y` is a friend of `z`, this doesn't guarantee that `x` is a friend of `z`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 2, languages = [[1],[2],[1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can either teach user 1 the second language or user 2 the first language.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, languages = [[2],[1,3],[1,2],[3]], friendships = [[1,4],[1,2],[3,4],[2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Teach the third language to users 1 and 3, yielding two users to teach.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 500`
- `languages.length == m`
- `1 <= m <= 500`
- `1 <= languages[i].length <= n`
- `1 <= languages[i][j] <= n`
- `1 <= ui < vi <= languages.length`
- `1 <= friendships.length <= 500`
- All tuples `(ui, vi)` are unique
- `languages[i]` contains only unique values
**Other Solution:**
```
int minimumTeachings(int n1, vector<vector<int>>& languages, vector<vector<int>>& friendships) {
        int n;
        int m;
        vector<bitset<501>> dp;
        n = n1;
        m = languages.size();
        dp.resize(m + 1);
        for (int i =0; i < m; i++)
        {
            for (auto& l : languages[i])
            {
                dp[i + 1][l] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        vector<int> candicate(m + 1, 0);
        for (auto& v : friendships)
        {
            bitset<501> un = dp[v[0]] & dp[v[1]];
            if (un.count() == 0)
            {
                candicate[v[0]] = 1;
                candicate[v[1]] = 1;
            }
        }
        vector<int> ldp(n + 1, 0);
        int cnt = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++)
        {
            if (candicate[i] == 1)
            {
                cnt++;
                for (auto& l : languages[i-1])
                {
                    ldp[l]++;
                }
            }
        }
        int res = cnt;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
        {
            res = min(res, cnt - ldp[i]);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

First, we remember whether two friends could communicate with each other. And then we should check all the language to see for this one, we should teach how many people. Finally, we can find the minimum number in the ldp, which remember the number of people we should teach.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
