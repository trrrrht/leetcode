**Problem:**
Winter is coming! During the contest, your first job is to design a standard heater with a fixed warm radius to warm all the houses.

Every house can be warmed, as long as the house is within the heater's warm radius range. 

Given the positions of `houses` and `heaters` on a horizontal line, return *the minimum radius standard of heaters so that those heaters could cover all houses.*

**Notice** that all the `heaters` follow your radius standard, and the warm radius will the same.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3], heaters = [2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only heater was placed in the position 2, and if we use the radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: houses = [1,2,3,4], heaters = [1,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: The two heater was placed in the position 1 and 4. We need to use radius 1 standard, then all the houses can be warmed.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [1,5], heaters = [2]
Output: 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= houses.length, heaters.length <= 3 * 104`
- `1 <= houses[i], heaters[i] <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int findRadius(vector<int>& houses, vector<int>& heaters) {
        sort(heaters.begin(), heaters.end());
        int minRadius = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < houses.size(); i++) {
            auto larger = lower_bound(heaters.begin(), heaters.end(), houses[i]);
            int curRadius = INT_MAX;
            if (larger != heaters.end())
                curRadius = *larger - houses[i];
            if (larger != heaters.begin()) {
                auto smaller = larger - 1;
                curRadius = min(curRadius, houses[i] - *smaller);
            }
            minRadius = max(minRadius, curRadius);
        }
        return minRadius;
    }
```
