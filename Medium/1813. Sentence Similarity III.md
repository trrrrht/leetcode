**Problem:**
A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. For example, `"Hello World"`, `"HELLO"`, `"hello world hello world"` are all sentences. Words consist of **only** uppercase and lowercase English letters.

Two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2` are **similar** if it is possible to insert an arbitrary sentence **(possibly empty)** inside one of these sentences such that the two sentences become equal. For example, `sentence1 = "Hello my name is Jane"` and `sentence2 = "Hello Jane"` can be made equal by inserting `"my name is"` between `"Hello"` and `"Jane"` in `sentence2`.

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, return `true` *if* `sentence1` *and* `sentence2` *are similar.* Otherwise, return `false`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: sentence1 = "My name is Haley", sentence2 = "My Haley"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting "name is" between "My" and "Haley".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: sentence1 = "of", sentence2 = "A lot of words"
Output: false
Explanation: No single sentence can be inserted inside one of the sentences to make it equal to the other.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: sentence1 = "Eating right now", sentence2 = "Eating"
Output: true
Explanation: sentence2 can be turned to sentence1 by inserting "right now" at the end of the sentence.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: sentence1 = "Luky", sentence2 = "Lucccky"
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= sentence1.length, sentence2.length <= 100`
- `sentence1` and `sentence2` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and spaces.
- The words in `sentence1` and `sentence2` are separated by a single space.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool areSentencesSimilar(string s, string l) {
        if (l.size() == s.size())
            return s == l;
        if (l.size() < s.size())
            swap(s, l);
        int ss = -1, ls = s.size(), d = l.size() - s.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() && s[i] == l[i]; ++i)
            ss = s[i] == ' ' || l[i + 1] == ' ' ? i : ss;
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= max(0, ss) && s[i] == l[d + i]; --i)
            ls = s[i] == ' ' || l[d + i - 1] == ' ' ? i : ls;
        return ss == s.size() - 1 || ls == 0 || ss == ls;
    }
```
Correctness:

We could check the short one whether the left part and right part(probably not exist) are the left part and right part of the long one

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
