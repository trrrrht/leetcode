**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `values` where values[i] represents the value of the `ith` sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have a **distance** `j - i` between them.

The score of a pair (`i < j`) of sightseeing spots is `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`: the sum of the values of the sightseeing spots, minus the distance between them.

Return *the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: values = [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2, values[i] + values[j] + i - j = 8 + 5 + 0 - 2 = 11
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: values = [1,2]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= values.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= values[i] <= 1000`
**Other Solution 1:**
```
int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& values) {
        int size = values.size(), curMax = INT_MIN, res = INT_MIN;
        vector<int> maxMinus(size, values[size - 1] - size + 1);
        for (int i = size - 2; i >= 0; --i)
        {
            maxMinus[i] = max(maxMinus[i + 1], values[i] - i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < size - 1; ++i)
        {
            int score = values[i] + i + maxMinus[i + 1];
            res = score > res ? score : res;
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

If we change the equation from values[i] + values[j] + i - j to (values[i] + i) + (values[j] - j), all we need to do is that we should fin the max values[i] + i and values[j] - j. In this case, we can use a array to store maxminus[i], where maxminus[i] means the biggest values[i] - i starting from index i to the end of the array.

After that, for each maxminus[i], we should calculate values[i] + i to see whether their addition is the biggest among all the i.

**Other Solution 2:**
```
int maxScoreSightseeingPair(vector<int>& A) {
        int res = 0, cur = 0;
        for (int a: A) {
            res = max(res, cur + a);
            cur = max(cur, a) - 1;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

In this problem, we can see that i - j is acuallty the distance between values[i] and values[j]. In this case, for values[i] and values[j], we just have to also calculate the distance between them. 

We use res as the return ultimate result. In this case, res should get the max one from itself and cur + a, where a is the value we are searching now and cur is the sum of the distance between now and the previous value.

For cur, we should select the biggest value in the array, so we should compare cur and a to get the max number now. For the -1 part, it's the distance between two cur we select. Here it's how it works. When the input array is [8, 1, 9, 2, 6], in the first loop, res get value[0] as the max value and cur also get value[0] as its max value. However, we should use cur minus 1 since in the second loop, res should use cur to add a, which means values[0] + values[1]. And if we use cur minus 1 in the first loop, we get this -1 is 0 - 1, which means for index 0 and 1, we get the values[0] + values[1] + 0 - 1.

In the later loop, if cur is smaller than a, the before distance get eliminated and start from now. In this way, we can finally get the max values[i] + values[j] + i - j.
