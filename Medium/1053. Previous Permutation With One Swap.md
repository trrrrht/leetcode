**Problem:**
Given an array of positive integers `arr` (not necessarily distinct), return *the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than* `arr`, that can be **made with exactly one swap** (A *swap* exchanges the positions of two numbers `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`). If it cannot be done, then return the same array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,5]
Explanation: This is already the smallest permutation.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: arr = [3,1,1,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3]
Explanation: Swapping 1 and 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 104`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= 104`
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> prevPermOpt1(vector<int>& arr) {
        int index = -1;
        int rightmin = 10e4 + 1;
        int size = arr.size();
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (rightmin > arr[i]) {
                rightmin = arr[i];
            }
            if (rightmin < arr[i]) {
                index = i;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (index == -1) {
            return arr;
        }
        int swapindex = -1;
        int rightmax = 0;
        for (int i = index + 1; i < size; i++) {
            if (arr[i] < arr[index] && rightmax < arr[i]) {
                rightmax = arr[i];
                swapindex = i;
            }
        }
        swap(arr[index], arr[swapindex]);
        return arr;
    }
```
Correctness:

We want to find the array that is exactly smaller than this current array in the whole combination of these numbers. In this case, we should find the first number that has at least one smaller number in its right in this array. After that, we scan from this number's right to the end of the array to find the biggest number that is smaller than that number and swap them.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
