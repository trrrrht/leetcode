**Problem:**
You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a `k` **duplicate removal** consists of choosing `k` adjacent and equal letters from `s` and removing them, causing the left and the right side of the deleted substring to concatenate together.

We repeatedly make `k` **duplicate removals** on `s` until we no longer can.

Return the final string after all such duplicate removals have been made. It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcd", k = 2
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: There's nothing to delete.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pbbcggttciiippooaais", k = 2
Output: "ps"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `2 <= k <= 104`
- `s` only contains lower case English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
string removeDuplicates(string s, int k) {
        vector<pair<int, char>> stack = {{0, '#'}};
        for (char c: s) {
            if (stack.back().second != c) {
                stack.push_back({1, c});
            } else if (++stack.back().first == k)
                stack.pop_back();
        }
        string res;
        for (auto & p : stack) {
            res.append(p.first, p.second);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
