**Problem:**
Alice and Bob play a game with piles of stones. There are an **even** number of piles arranged in a row, and each pile has a **positive** integer number of stones `piles[i]`.

The objective of the game is to end with the most stones. The **total** number of stones across all the piles is **odd**, so there are no ties.

Alice and Bob take turns, with **Alice starting first**. Each turn, a player takes the entire pile of stones either from the **beginning** or from the **end** of the row. This continues until there are no more piles left, at which point the person with the **most stones wins**.

Assuming Alice and Bob play optimally, return `true` *if Alice wins the game, or* `false` *if Bob wins*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: piles = [5,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: 
Alice starts first, and can only take the first 5 or the last 5.
Say she takes the first 5, so that the row becomes [3, 4, 5].
If Bob takes 3, then the board is [4, 5], and Alice takes 5 to win with 10 points.
If Bob takes the last 5, then the board is [3, 4], and Alice takes 4 to win with 9 points.
This demonstrated that taking the first 5 was a winning move for Alice, so we return true.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: piles = [3,7,2,3]
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= piles.length <= 500`
- `piles.length` is **even**.
- `1 <= piles[i] <= 500`
- `sum(piles[i])` is **odd**.
**Other Solution 1:**
```
bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

If there are only 2 piles, we know Alice will always win. If ther are 4 piles, Alice will win again. If she takes the first pile first, she can always take the third one. If she takes the fourth pile first, she can always take the second one. In this case, she can pick whatever combination she wants to win, because one of first + thrid and second + fourth must be larger than the other one.

We can extend this idea to n piles by coloring all the stones the players will choose with two different colors. One of the color stones must be more than the other one.

Complexity:

Time: O(1)
Space: O(1)
**Other Solution 2:**
```
bool stoneGame(vector<int>& piles) {
        int N = piles.size();
        int dp[N+2][N+2];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof(dp));

        for (int size = 1; size <= N; ++size)
            for (int i = 0, j = size - 1; j < N; ++i, ++j) {
                int parity = (j + i + N) % 2; 
                if (parity == 1)
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = max(piles[i] + dp[i+2][j+1], piles[j] + dp[i+1][j]);
                else
                    dp[i+1][j+1] = min(-piles[i] + dp[i+2][j+1], -piles[j] + dp[i+1][j]);
            }

        return dp[1][N] > 0;
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i][j] represents the largest Alice could get between indices i and j. If it's Alice's turn, she will increase her score. If it's Lee's turn, he will decrease Alice's score.
