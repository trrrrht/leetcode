**Problem:**
You are given a string `s`.

A split is called **good** if you can split `s` into two non-empty strings `sleft` and `sright` where their concatenation is equal to `s` (i.e., `sleft + sright = s`) and the number of distinct letters in `sleft` and `sright` is the same.

Return *the number of **good splits** you can make in `s`*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aacaba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 5 ways to split "aacaba" and 2 of them are good. 
("a", "acaba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aa", "caba") Left string and right string contains 1 and 3 different letters respectively.
("aac", "aba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aaca", "ba") Left string and right string contains 2 and 2 different letters respectively (good split).
("aacab", "a") Left string and right string contains 3 and 1 different letters respectively.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: 1
Explanation: Split the string as follows ("ab", "cd").
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

**Other Solution:**
```
int numSplits(string s) {
        int l[26] = {}, r[26] = {}, d_l = 0, d_r = 0, res = 0;
        for (auto ch : s)
            d_r += ++r[ch - 'a'] == 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            d_l += ++l[s[i] - 'a'] == 1;
            d_r -= --r[s[i] - 'a'] == 0;
            res += d_l == d_r;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use pre-sum to speed the split

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
