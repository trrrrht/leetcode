**Problem:**
There is a special square room with mirrors on each of the four walls. Except for the southwest corner, there are receptors on each of the remaining corners, numbered `0`, `1`, and `2`.

The square room has walls of length `p` and a laser ray from the southwest corner first meets the east wall at a distance `q` from the `0th` receptor.

Given the two integers `p` and `q`, return *the number of the receptor that the ray meets first*.

The test cases are guaranteed so that the ray will meet a receptor eventually.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The ray meets receptor 2 the first time it gets reflected back to the left wall.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: p = 3, q = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= q <= p <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int mirrorReflection(int p, int q) {
        return (p & -p) > (q & -q) ? 2 : (p & -p) < (q & -q) ? 0:1;
    }
```
Correctness:

The reflection is like we use multiple square room to overlap together and see the line.
