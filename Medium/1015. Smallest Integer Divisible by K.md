**Problem:**
Given a positive integer `k`, you need to find the **length** of the **smallest** positive integer `n` such that `n` is divisible by `k`, and `n` only contains the digit `1`.

Return *the **length** of* `n`. If there is no such `n`, return -1.

**Note:** `n` may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 1, which has length 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: There is no such positive integer n divisible by 2.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The smallest answer is n = 111, which has length 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 105`
**Other Solution:**
```
int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        for (int r = 0, N = 1; N <= K; ++N)
            if ((r = (r * 10 + 1) % K) == 0)
                return N;
        return -1;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want the numbers who only contain 1s, we should use 1 to multiply 10 and add 1 to get the next one. 1->11->111->......and test whether it's divisible by k

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
