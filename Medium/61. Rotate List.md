**Problem:**
Given the `head` of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [4,5,1,2,3]
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/13/roate2.jpg)

```
Input: head = [0,1,2], k = 4
Output: [2,0,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[0, 500]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
ListNode* rotateRight(ListNode* head, int k) 
    {
        if(head == nullptr || k == 0)
            return head;
        
        ListNode *curr = head, *prev = nullptr, *tail = nullptr;
        int len = 0;
       
        while(curr)
        {
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
            ++len;
        }
        
        tail = prev;
        
        k =  k % len;
        
        if(k == 0)
            return head;
        
        k = len - k;
        
        curr = head;
        while(k)
        {
            prev = curr;
            curr = curr->next;
            --k;
        }
        
        ListNode *new_head = curr;
        prev->next = nullptr;
        tail->next = head; 
        
        return new_head;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to separate the list into two parts. The second part starts from the k node. And then we put the first part to the tail of the second part.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
