**Problem:**
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:

- After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on the next day (i.e., cooldown one day).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,0,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 5000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices){
		if (prices.size() <= 1) return 0;
		vector<int> s0(prices.size(), 0);
		vector<int> s1(prices.size(), 0);
		vector<int> s2(prices.size(), 0);
		s1[0] = -prices[0];
		s0[0] = 0;
		s2[0] = INT_MIN;
		for (int i = 1; i < prices.size(); i++) {
			s0[i] = max(s0[i - 1], s2[i - 1]);
			s1[i] = max(s1[i - 1], s0[i - 1] - prices[i]);
			s2[i] = s1[i - 1] + prices[i];
		}
		return max(s0[prices.size() - 1], s2[prices.size() - 1]);
	}
```

Original imageThere are three states, according to the action that you can take.Hence, from there, you can now the profit at a state at time i as:s0[i] = max(s0[i - 1], s2[i - 1]); // Stay at s0, or rest from s2
s1[i] = max(s1[i - 1], s0[i - 1] - prices[i]); // Stay at s1, or buy from s0
s2[i] = s1[i - 1] + prices[i]; // Only one way from s1
