**Problem:**
A **wonderful** string is a string where **at most one** letter appears an **odd** number of times.

- For example, `"ccjjc"` and `"abab"` are wonderful, but `"ab"` is not.

Given a string `word` that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters (`'a'` through `'j'`), return *the **number of wonderful non-empty substrings** in* `word`*. If the same substring appears multiple times in* `word`*, then count **each occurrence** separately.*

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The four wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "b"
- "aba" -> "a"
- "aba" -> "aba"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "aabb"
Output: 9
Explanation: The nine wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "aa"
- "aabb" -> "aab"
- "aabb" -> "aabb"
- "aabb" -> "a"
- "aabb" -> "abb"
- "aabb" -> "b"
- "aabb" -> "bb"
- "aabb" -> "b"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word = "he"
Output: 2
Explanation: The two wonderful substrings are underlined below:
- "he" -> "h"
- "he" -> "e"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word.length <= 105`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters from `'a'` to `'j'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
long long wonderfulSubstrings(string word) {
        vector<int> count(1024);
        long long res = 0, cur = 0;
        count[0] = 1L;
        for (char& c: word) {
            cur ^= 1 << (c - 'a');
            res += count[cur]++;
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
                res += count[cur ^ (1 << i)];
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correcntess:


Use a mask to count the current prefix string.
mask & 1 means whether it has odd 'a'
mask & 2 means whether it has odd 'b'
mask & 4 means whether it has odd 'c'
...We find the number of wonderful string with all even number of characters.
Then we flip each of bits, 10 at most, and doing this again.
This will help to find string with at most one odd number of characters.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
