**Problem:**
You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

- A stone `'#'`
- A stationary obstacle `'*'`
- Empty `'.'`

The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `box` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return *an* `n x m` *matrix representing the box after the rotation described above*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: box = [["#",".","#"]]
Output: [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: box = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
Output: [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)

```
Input: box = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
Output: [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == box.length`
- `n == box[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `box[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.
**My Solution:**
```
vector<vector<char>> rotateTheBox(vector<vector<char>>& box) {
        vector<vector<char>> result(box[0].size(), vector<char> (box.size(), '.'));
        for (int i = 0; i < box.size(); i++) {
            int empty = box[i].size() - 1;
            for (int j = box[i].size() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (box[i][j] == '*') {
                    empty = j - 1;
                    result[j][box.size() - i - 1] = '*';
                }
                else if (box[i][j] == '#') {
                    result[empty][box.size() - i - 1] = '#';
                    empty--;
                }
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
