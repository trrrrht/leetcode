**Problem:**
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence equals `difference`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from `arr` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1,2,3,4].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7,5,3,1].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `-104 <= arr[i], difference <= 104`
**My Solution:**
```
int longestSubsequence(vector<int>& arr, int difference) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            umap[arr[i]] = umap[arr[i] - difference] + 1;
            result = max(umap[arr[i]], result);
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each number, we just have to save it and find the corresponding pre-number. If the original array is not sorted, we should sort first

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
