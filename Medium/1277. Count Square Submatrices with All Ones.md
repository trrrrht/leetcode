**Problem:**
Given a `m * n` matrix of ones and zeros, return how many **square** submatrices have all ones.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix =
[
  [0,1,1,1],
  [1,1,1,1],
  [0,1,1,1]
]
Output: 15
Explanation: 
There are 10 squares of side 1.
There are 4 squares of side 2.
There is  1 square of side 3.
Total number of squares = 10 + 4 + 1 = 15.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = 
[
  [1,0,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [1,1,0]
]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
There are 6 squares of side 1.  
There is 1 square of side 2. 
Total number of squares = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 300`
- `1 <= arr[0].length <= 300`
- `0 <= arr[i][j] <= 1`

**Other Solution:**
```
int countSquares(vector<vector<int>>& matrix) {
        int count = 0;
        if(matrix.size()==0)
            return count;
        for(int i=0; i<matrix.size(); ++i)
        {
            for(int j=0; j<matrix[i].size(); ++j)
            {
                if(i== 0 || j == 0)
                {
                    if(matrix[i][j] == 1)
                        count++;
                    
                }
                else if(matrix[i][j] == 1)
                {
                    matrix[i][j] = min(min(matrix[i][j-1],matrix[i-1][j-1]),matrix[i-1][j])+1;
                    count = count + matrix[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

To calculate the number of square submatrices in the matrix, we can extend every small submatrices to get a bigger one, which means, if we find the value in a cell is 1 and its neighbours (up, left, left-up) have formed k by k square, we can get a k + 1 by k + 1 square after adding this one.

In this case, when we find 1 in the matrix, we should check all its neighbours' value to get the k square it forms, where k is the minimum value of its neighbour because if we can form a larger square depends the smallest k square its neighbours form.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
