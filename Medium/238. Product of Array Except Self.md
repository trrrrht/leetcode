**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums`, return *an array* `answer` *such that* `answer[i]` *is equal to the product of all the elements of* `nums` *except* `nums[i]`.

The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `-30 <= nums[i] <= 30`
- The product of any prefix or suffix of `nums` is **guaranteed** to fit in a **32-bit** integer.

 

**Follow up:**

- Could you solve it in `O(n)` time complexity and without using division?
- Could you solve it with `O(1)` constant space complexity? (The output array **does not** count as extra space for space complexity analysis.)
**My Solution:**
```
vector<int> productExceptSelf(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> product(nums.size(), 1);
        int tmp = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            product[i] = product[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        for (int i = nums.size() - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            tmp *= nums[i + 1];
            product[i] *= tmp;
        }
        return product;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to know the products of numbers in the left and right of each number, so we can scan from the start to end and then scan from end to start to find all the products (using the result as space instead of adding new space).

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
