**Problem:**
You have a list `arr` of all integers in the range `[1, n]` sorted in a strictly increasing order. Apply the following algorithm on `arr`:

- Starting from left to right, remove the first number and every other number afterward until you reach the end of the list.
- Repeat the previous step again, but this time from right to left, remove the rightmost number and every other number from the remaining numbers.
- Keep repeating the steps again, alternating left to right and right to left, until a single number remains.

Given the integer `n`, return *the last number that remains in* `arr`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 6
Explanation:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
arr = [2, 4, 6, 8]
arr = [2, 6]
arr = [6]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int lastRemaining(int n) {
        int head=1, step=1;
        bool direction=true;
        while (n>1) {
            if (direction)
                head+=step;
            else
                head+=n%2==0?0:step;
            step*=2;
            n/=2;
            direction=!direction;
        }
        return head;
    }
```
