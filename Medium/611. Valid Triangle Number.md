**Problem:**
Given an array consists of non-negative integers, your task is to count the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Valid combinations are: 
2,3,4 (using the first 2)
2,3,4 (using the second 2)
2,2,3
```



**Note:**

1. The length of the given array won't exceed 1000.
2. The integers in the given array are in the range of [0, 1000].
**Other Solution 1:**
```
int triangleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int k;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            k = i + 2;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.size() - 1 && nums[i] != 0; j++) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[j];
                while (k < nums.size() && nums[k] < sum) {
                    k++;
                }
                count += k - j - 1;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just fix the first two numbers and try to find the one which satisfies the requirement of a triangle.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
**Other Solution 2:**
Also, we can use binary search to find the k. However, the time complexity will be O($n^2logn$), because although we try to skip some elements in this algorithm, for each j, we should use O(logn) binary search to find k. It's not like the solution1, where the k is not affected by j, so the time complexity of inner loop of solution 1 should be O(n).
