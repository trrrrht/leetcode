**Problem:**
Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return *the number of* `words[i]` *that is a subsequence of* `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int numMatchingSubseq(string s, vector<string>& words) {
        int count = 0;
        vector<vector<int>> schars(s.size() + 1, vector<int> (26, -1));
        for (int i = s.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                schars[i][j] = schars[i + 1][j];
            }
            schars[i][s[i] - 'a'] = i;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < words.size(); i++) {
            string word = words[i];
            int k = 0;
            bool flag = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < word.size(); j++) {
                if (k >= s.size() || schars[k][word[j] - 'a'] == -1) {
                    flag = false;
                    break;
                }
                k = schars[k][word[j] - 'a'] + 1;
            }
            if (flag) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to calculate how many words are the subword of the string, we should check all the word. In this case, we should save the position of each char in the string to reduce the running time when we try to match the char in the word with the char in the string. We  use map to remember the position of char i in the string. For position i, we should also save the next position of different chars in the [i + 1, size] to tell whether we should continue match the char in the word (If we match char j in word with char i in string, we should check whether we can find char j + 1 in word from the map, because if char j + 1 exist in the string behind char i, we'll remember it at map[i] too).

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
