**Problem:**
You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`.

A string `b` is a **subset** of string `a` if every letter in `b` occurs in `a` including multiplicity.

- For example, `"wrr"` is a subset of `"warrior"` but is not a subset of `"world"`.

A string `a` from `words1` is **universal** if for every string `b` in `words2`, `b` is a subset of `a`.

Return an array of all the **universal** strings in `words1`. You may return the answer in **any order**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["e","o"]
Output: ["facebook","google","leetcode"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words1 = ["amazon","apple","facebook","google","leetcode"], words2 = ["l","e"]
Output: ["apple","google","leetcode"]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words1.length, words2.length <= 104`
- `1 <= words1[i].length, words2[i].length <= 10`
- `words1[i]` and `words2[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `words1` are **unique**.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<string> wordSubsets(vector<string>& A, vector<string>& B) {
        vector<int> count(26), tmp(26);
        int i;
        for (string b : B) {
            tmp = counter(b);
            for (i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
                count[i] = max(count[i], tmp[i]);
        }
        vector<string> res;
        for (string a : A) {
            tmp = counter(a);
            for (i = 0; i < 26; ++i)
                if (tmp[i] < count[i])
                    break;
            if (i == 26) res.push_back(a);
        }
        return res;
    }

    vector<int> counter(string& word) {
        vector<int> count(26);
        for (char c : word) count[c - 'a']++;
        return count;
    }
```
