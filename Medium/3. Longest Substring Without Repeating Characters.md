**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
**Other Solution:**
```
int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> dict(256, -1);
        int maxLen = 0, start = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i != s.length(); i++) {
            if (dict[s[i]] > start)
                start = dict[s[i]];
            dict[s[i]] = i;
            maxLen = max(maxLen, i - start);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
```
Correctness:

We use dict to save the new position of each char and use start to save the start of the substring. When we meet a char that is in the dict and the index is larger than start, we know it must be repeated, so we should start from this index. Otherwise, we just update the position of each char and get maxlen.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
