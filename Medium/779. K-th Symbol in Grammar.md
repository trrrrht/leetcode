**Problem:**
We build a table of `n` rows (**1-indexed**). We start by writing `0` in the `1st` row. Now in every subsequent row, we look at the previous row and replace each occurrence of `0` with `01`, and each occurrence of `1` with `10`.

- For example, for `n = 3`, the `1st` row is `0`, the `2nd` row is `01`, and the `3rd` row is `0110`.

Given two integer `n` and `k`, return the `kth` (**1-indexed**) symbol in the `nth` row of a table of `n` rows.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: row 1: 0
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, k = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation:
row 1: 0
row 2: 01
row 3: 0110
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 30`
- `1 <= k <= 2n - 1`
**Other Solution:**
```
int kthGrammar(int N, int K) {
        return bitset<32>(K - 1).count() & 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

The k-th number could be get by k-th / 2 number
