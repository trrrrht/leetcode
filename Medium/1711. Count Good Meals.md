**Problem:**
A **good meal** is a meal that contains **exactly two different food items** with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.

You can pick **any** two different foods to make a good meal.

Given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the `ith` item of food, return *the number of different **good meals** you can make from this list modulo* `109 + 7`.

Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,3,5,7,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The good meals are (1,3), (1,7), (3,5) and, (7,9).
Their respective sums are 4, 8, 8, and 16, all of which are powers of 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: deliciousness = [1,1,1,3,3,3,7]
Output: 15
Explanation: The good meals are (1,1) with 3 ways, (1,3) with 9 ways, and (1,7) with 3 ways.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105`
- `0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220`
**My Solution:**
```
int countPairs(vector<int>& deliciousness) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        int count = 0;
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        vector<int> power(22);
        int num = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < 22; i++) {
            power[i] = num;
            num *= 2;
            num %= MOD;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < deliciousness.size(); i++) {
            int d = deliciousness[i] % MOD;
            for (int j = 0; j < 22; j++) {
                int s = power[j] - d;
                if (umap.find(s) != umap.end()) {
                    count += umap[s];
                    count %= MOD;
                }
            }
            umap[d]++;
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

We could firstly calculate all the power of 2 and put them in a map. For each element in the array, we can get the number of the good meals

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
