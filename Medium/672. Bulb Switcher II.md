**Problem:**
There is a room with `n` bulbs labeled from `1` to `n` that all are turned on initially, and **four buttons** on the wall. Each of the four buttons has a different functionality where:

- **Button 1:** Flips the status of all the bulbs.
- **Button 2:** Flips the status of all the bulbs with even labels (i.e., `2, 4, ...`).
- **Button 3:** Flips the status of all the bulbs with odd labels (i.e., `1, 3, ...`).
- **Button 4:** Flips the status of all the bulbs with a label `j = 3k + 1` where `k = 0, 1, 2, ...` (i.e., `1, 4, 7, 10, ...`).

You will press one of the four mentioned buttons exactly `presses` times.

Given the two integers `n` and `presses`, return *the number of **different statuses** after pressing the four buttons **exactly*** `presses` *times*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, presses = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Status can be: [on], [off].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, presses = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: Status can be: [on, off], [off, on], [off, off].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, presses = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Status can be: [off, on, off], [on, off, on], [off, off, off], [off, on, on].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= presses <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int flipLights(int n, int presses) {
        if (presses == 0 || n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 2;
        if (n == 2) return presses == 1? 3:4;
        if (presses == 1) return 4;
        return presses == 2? 7:8;
    }
```
