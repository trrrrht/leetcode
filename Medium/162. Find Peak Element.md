**Problem:**
A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

**Other Solution:**
```
int findPeakElement(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (high > low) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                high = mid;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
```
Correctness:

According to the problem, we know peak element is larger than both the left and right neighbour of itself. In that case, if we find a element that is bigger than its neighbour, we know it may be the peak number and we should check whether it's bigger than the element on the other side. 

For example, if we find nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1], we know nums[mid] might be the one we want, so we should check the one on the left of it by adjusting high to its index. The worst case of this is all the number are bigger than the right one, so we'll change high to 0. Since nums[-1] is -INT_MAX, we know the nums[0] is one of the numbers we want.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
