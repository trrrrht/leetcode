**Problem:**
There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. We asked n rabbits **"How many rabbits have the same color as you?"** and collected the answers in an integer array `answers` where `answers[i]` is the answer of the `ith` rabbit.

Given the array `answers`, return *the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: answers = [1,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
The two rabbits that answered "1" could both be the same color, say red.
The rabbit that answered "2" can't be red or the answers would be inconsistent.
Say the rabbit that answered "2" was blue.
Then there should be 2 other blue rabbits in the forest that didn't answer into the array.
The smallest possible number of rabbits in the forest is therefore 5: 3 that answered plus 2 that didn't.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: answers = [10,10,10]
Output: 11
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= answers.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= answers[i] < 1000`
**My Solution:**
```
int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int, int> umap;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < answers.size(); i++) {
            umap[answers[i]]++;
        }
        for (auto i = umap.begin(); i != umap.end(); i++) {
            int color = (*i).first;
            int number = (*i).second;
            while (number > 0) {
                number -= color + 1;
                result += color + 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

According to the problem, we know the rabbits who have the same color must have the same answers, so we should calculate the frequency of each answer. For each answer, we know answer + 1 is the number of one specific color rabbits. After we check all the answers in the array, we could get the total number of rabbits.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
