**Problem:**
You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game on an infinite 2-D grid. You start at the point `[0, 0]`, and you are given a destination point `target = [xtarget, ytarget]`, which you are trying to get to. There are several ghosts on the map with their starting positions given as an array `ghosts`, where `ghosts[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the starting position of the `ith` ghost. All inputs are **integral coordinates**.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts may independently choose to either **move 1 unit** in any of the four cardinal directions: north, east, south, or west or **stay still**. All actions happen **simultaneously**.

You escape if and only if you can reach the target **before** any ghost reaches you. If you reach any square (including the target) at the **same time** as a ghost, it **does not** count as an escape.

Return `true` *if it is possible to escape, otherwise return* `false`*.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ghosts = [[1,0],[0,3]], target = [0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: You can reach the destination (0, 1) after 1 turn, while the ghosts located at (1, 0) and (0, 3) cannot catch up with you.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ghosts = [[1,0]], target = [2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: You need to reach the destination (2, 0), but the ghost at (1, 0) lies between you and the destination.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: ghosts = [[2,0]], target = [1,0]
Output: false
Explanation: The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: ghosts = [[5,0],[-10,-2],[0,-5],[-2,-2],[-7,1]], target = [7,7]
Output: false
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: ghosts = [[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,1],[-1,0]], target = [0,0]
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= ghosts.length <= 100`
- `ghosts[i].length == 2`
- `-104 <= xi, yi <= 104`
- There can be **multiple ghosts** in the same location.
- `target.length == 2`
- `-104 <= xtarget, ytarget <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool escapeGhosts(vector<vector<int>>& ghosts, vector<int>& t) {
        int d = abs(t[0]) + abs(t[1]);
        for(auto g: ghosts)
            if (d >= abs(t[0] - g[0]) + abs(t[1] - g[1]))
                return false;
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's proofed that if and only if ghosts could catch the people by going directly to the target before people could get there.
