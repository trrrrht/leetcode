**Problem:**
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The **words** in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return *a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.*

**Note** that `s` may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: s = "  Bob    Loves  Alice   "
Output: "Alice Loves Bob"
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: s = "Alice does not even like bob"
Output: "bob like even not does Alice"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
- There is **at least one** word in `s`.

 

**Follow-up:** If the string data type is mutable in your language, can you solve it **in-place** with `O(1)` extra space?
**Other Solution:**
```
void reverseword(string &s, int i, int j){
        while(i<j){
          char t=s[i];
          s[i++]=s[j];
          s[j--]=t;
        } 
    }
    
    string reverseWords(string &s) {
        
        int i=0, j=0;
        int l=0;
        int len=s.length();
        int wordcount=0;
        
        while(true){
            while(i<len && s[i] == ' ') i++; 
            if(i==len) break;
            if(wordcount) s[j++]=' ';
            l=j;
            while(i<len && s[i] != ' ') {s[j]=s[i]; j++; i++;} 
            reverseword(s,l,j-1);                
            wordcount++;
            
        }
        
        s.resize(j);                
        reverseword(s,0,j-1);       
        return s;
    }
```
Correctness:

We reverse each word separately and then reverse the whole sentence to get the result

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
