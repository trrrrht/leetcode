**Problem:**
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`

 

**Follow up:** Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in `O(n log(n))` time complexity?
**Other Solution:**
```
int lengthOfLIS(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<int> sub;
        for (int x : nums) {
            if (sub.empty() || sub[sub.size() - 1] < x) {
                sub.push_back(x);
            } else {
                auto it = lower_bound(sub.begin(), sub.end(), x); 
                *it = x;
            }
        }
        return sub.size();
    }
```
Correctness:

We maintain a increasing stack by adding a larger element. If we meet a element that is smaller than the last element in the stack, we use binary search to check where should it be put and replace the one in the stack(try to find another longer subsequence). In this case, the new one could be a "fake" last one.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
