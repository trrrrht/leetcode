**Problem:**
A robot is located at the top-left corner of a `m x n` grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).

The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).

How many possible unique paths are there?

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/robot_maze.png)

```
Input: m = 3, n = 7
Output: 28
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
1. Right -> Down -> Down
2. Down -> Down -> Right
3. Down -> Right -> Down
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: m = 7, n = 3
Output: 28
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3
Output: 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- It's guaranteed that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 109`.

**My Solution:**
```
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<vector<int>> count(m, vector<int>(n));
        count[0][0] = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i > 0) {
                    count[i][j] += count[i - 1][j];
                }
                if (j > 0) {
                    count[i][j] += count[i][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return count[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
```

Correctness:

At first, I tried to use DFS to solve this problem, but it's out of time. After checking this problem more carefully, I found that the number of unique paths is depends on the number of unique paths of its up and left blank because this robot can only move down or right.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)

**Other Solution 1:**
```
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        int N = m+n-2;
        int r = m-1;
        double res = 1;
        
        for(int i = 1; i<=r; i++){
            res = res * (N - r + i)/i;
        }
        
        
        return (int)res;
    }
```
Correctness:

It's a simple when we use the way in discrete math. Actually it's just a combination number. We have to walk m + n - 2 steps to reach the star and m - 1 of them are horizontal, n - 1 of them are vertical, so we just choose m - 1 from m + n - 2 as horizontal, all the steps are settled. The combiantion number is $C_{m + n - 2}^{m - 1}$ or $C_{m + n - 2}^{n - 1}$

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution 2:**
To calculate each blank, we should just know the up and left blanks of it. In that case, we can use two 1-dimension vectors to replace the 2-dimension vector.
```
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> pre(n, 1), cur(n, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                cur[j] = pre[j] + cur[j - 1];
            }
            swap(pre, cur);
        }
        return pre[n - 1];
    }
```
Also, we can still reduce the space because pre is just the cur before update. In that case, we can update cur itself.
```
int uniquePaths(int m, int n) {
        vector<int> cur(n, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                cur[j] += cur[j - 1];
            }
        }
        return cur[n - 1];
    }
```
