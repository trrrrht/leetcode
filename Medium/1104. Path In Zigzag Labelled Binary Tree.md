**Problem:**
In an infinite binary tree where every node has two children, the nodes are labelled in row order.

In the odd numbered rows (ie., the first, third, fifth,...), the labelling is left to right, while in the even numbered rows (second, fourth, sixth,...), the labelling is right to left.

Given the `label` of a node in this tree, return the labels in the path from the root of the tree to the node with that `label`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: label = 14
Output: [1,3,4,14]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: label = 26
Output: [1,2,6,10,26]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= label <= 10^6`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> pathInZigZagTree(int label) {
        vector<int> result;
        result.push_back(label); 
        int height=log2(label);
        while(height!=0){
            int left=pow(2,height-1); 
            int right=pow(2,height)-1;
            label=left+(right-label/2);
            result.push_back(label);  
            height--;
        }
        reverse(result.begin(),result.end());
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

For left-to-right numbered tree, the parent node can be determined as label / 2. So for eigzag , we need to invert the parent node. The max label in this level is 1 << level - 1, and the minimum is 1 << (level - 1). Using this, we could get the parent 

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
