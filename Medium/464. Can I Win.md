**Problem:**
In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from `1` to `10`. The player who first causes the running total to **reach or exceed** 100 wins.

What if we change the game so that players **cannot** re-use integers?

For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.

Given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`, return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return `false`. Assume both players play **optimally**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 11
Output: false
Explanation:
No matter which integer the first player choose, the first player will lose.
The first player can choose an integer from 1 up to 10.
If the first player choose 1, the second player can only choose integers from 2 up to 10.
The second player will win by choosing 10 and get a total = 11, which is >= desiredTotal.
Same with other integers chosen by the first player, the second player will always win.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 0
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: maxChoosableInteger = 10, desiredTotal = 1
Output: true
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
- `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool canIWin(int M, int T) 
      {
        int sum = M*(M+1)/2; 
        if (T < 2) return true;
        else if (sum < T) return false;
        else if (sum == T) return M%2;
        else return dfs(M, T, 0);
      }

      bool dfs(int M, int T, int k) 
      {
        if (mem[k] != 0) return mem[k] > 0;
        if (T <= 0) return false;
        for (int i = 0; i < M; ++i)
          if (!(k&(1<<i)) && !dfs(M, T-i-1, k|(1<<i))) {
            mem[k] = 1;
            return true;
          } 
        mem[k] = -1;
        return false;      
      }
      int mem[1<<20] = {};
```
Correctness:

For each sequence of the numbers in the range, we should check whether first player could win. If in the ith round, the first player could pick i + 1 and the second player could not win, we should assume the first player wins.

Complexity:

Time: O(n!)
Space: O($10^n$)
