**Problem:**
A string of `'0'`s and `'1'`s is *monotone increasing* if it consists of some number of `'0'`s (possibly 0), followed by some number of `'1'`s (also possibly 0.)

We are given a string `S` of `'0'`s and `'1'`s, and we may flip any `'0'` to a `'1'` or a `'1'` to a `'0'`.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `S` monotone increasing.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "00110"
Output: 1
Explanation: We flip the last digit to get 00111.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "010110"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 011111, or alternatively 000111.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "00011000"
Output: 2
Explanation: We flip to get 00000000.
```

 

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 20000`
2. `S` only consists of `'0'` and `'1'` characters.
**Other Solution 1:**
```
int minFlipsMonoIncr(string S) {
        vector<int> left0(S.size());
        int count = 0;
        int minstep = 20001;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            if (S[i] == '1') {
                count++;
            }
            left0[i] = count;
        }
        count = 0;
        for (int i = S.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (S[i] == '0') {
                count++;
            }
            minstep = min(minstep, count + left0[i]);
        }
        return minstep - 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

We just have to calculate the number of 1 in the left part of the array and find the number of 0 in the right part of the array, since we have to change them.

In this case, we should save the number of left 1 for each index, and when we scan from the end to the start, we will know how many 1 should be changed and also how many 0 should be changed too.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
**Other Solution 2:**
```
int minFlipsMonoIncr(string S) {
        int ones = 0;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < S.size(); i++) {
            if (S[i] == '1') {
                ones++;
            }
            else {
                result = min(result + 1, ones);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

When we scan the array from the start to the end, if we meet '1', we know we should either change it (all the numbers before it are '0') or keep it, so we should use a variable to count the number of it. When we meet a 0, we should decide what to do according to the number of 1s. 

Since we want this array to be monotonic, all the 0s should be before 1s. In this case, when we meet 0, we should compare the steps that we change all the 1s before it to 0s and the steps that we change it to 1s after correcting the order before it.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
