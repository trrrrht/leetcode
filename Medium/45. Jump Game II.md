**Problem:**

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums`, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`

**My Solution:**
```
int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int position = 0;
        int size = nums.size() - 1;
        if (size == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        while (1) {
            int area = nums[position] + position;
            int step = 0;
            count++;
            if (area >= size) {
                break;
            }
            for (int i = position + 1; i <= min(area, size); i++) {
                if (step < i + nums[i]) {
                    step = i + nums[i];
                    position = i;
                }
            }
            if (position >= size) {
                break;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

We can use greedy algorithm to solve this problem. When we are at position i, we should check the area it can reach and assume that we already jump to position in that area to find next maximum area we can reach. In that case, for each step, we can reach the furthest position, which means we can use least step to reach terminal.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
This algorithm is another way to realize the former algorithm. It first searches in the area it can reach now to find the furthest position it can reach next. When it reaches the boundary of area now, it updates the target to go.
```
int jump(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        int max_reach = 0, max_end = 0, ans = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
            max_reach = max(max_reach, i + nums[i]);
            if (max_end == i) {
                ans++;
                max_end = max_reach;
            }
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
```
