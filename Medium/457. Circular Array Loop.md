**Problem:**
You are playing a game involving a **circular** array of non-zero integers `nums`. Each `nums[i]` denotes the number of indices forward/backward you must move if you are located at index `i`:

- If `nums[i]` is positive, move `nums[i]` steps **forward**, and
- If `nums[i]` is negative, move `nums[i]` steps **backward**.

Since the array is **circular**, you may assume that moving forward from the last element puts you on the first element, and moving backwards from the first element puts you on the last element.

A **cycle** in the array consists of a sequence of indices `seq` of length `k` where:

- Following the movement rules above results in the repeating index sequence `seq[0] -> seq[1] -> ... -> seq[k - 1] -> seq[0] -> ...`
- Every `nums[seq[j]]` is either **all positive** or **all negative**.
- `k > 1`

Return `true` *if there is a **cycle** in* `nums`*, or* `false` *otherwise*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,-1,1,2,2]
Output: true
Explanation:
There is a cycle from index 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0 -> ...
The cycle's length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 1 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because the sequence's length is 1.
By definition the sequence's length must be strictly greater than 1 to be a cycle.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-1,-2,-2]
Output: false
Explanation:
The sequence from index 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> ... is not a cycle because nums[1] is positive, but nums[2] is negative.
Every nums[seq[j]] must be either all positive or all negative.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 5000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `nums[i] != 0`

**Other Solution 1:**
```
int getpos(vector<int> &nums,int i,int direction) {
        bool curr_direction = nums[i] >= 0;
        if (curr_direction != direction) {
            return -1;
        }
        int index = (nums[i] + i + nums.size()) % nums.size();
        if(index == i) {
            return -1;
        }
        return index;
    }
    bool circularArrayLoop(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.size() < 2) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int fast = i;
            int slow = i;
            bool direction = nums[i] >= 0;
            while(1) {
                slow = getpos(nums, slow, direction);
                if (slow == -1) {
                    break;
                }
                fast = getpos(nums, fast, direction);
                if (fast == -1) {
                    break;
                }
                fast = getpos(nums, fast, direction);
                if(fast == -1) {
                    break;
                }
                if(slow == fast) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is like hare and tortoise. We set a fast pointer to chase slow pointer in a circle. If there's a circle in the array, they can meet again.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution 2:**
```

bool circularArrayLoop(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n = nums.size();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++ j) 
            nums[j] %= n; // After this, no number is > n or < -n.
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++ j) {
            int i = j, last_i = 0;
            bool is_forward = nums[i] > 0;
            while (nums[i] % n != 0 && nums[i] > 0 == is_forward) {
                last_i = i;
                i = (i + nums[i] + n) % n;
                nums[last_i] = (j + 1) * n;
                if (nums[i] == (j + 1) * n) //each round, use a different number as the "visited marker".
                    return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is based on the dfs algorithm. We can set a visited to remember whether we have check this path. However, we can also just change the number in the array to play the "mark" role. 

If we set a fixed mark to mark the path, we will face a problem: we meet the mark, but we don't know whether this mark belongs to the path before or the path now.

In that case, for each path, we should update the "mark".

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
