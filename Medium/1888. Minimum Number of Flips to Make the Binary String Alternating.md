**Problem:**
You are given a binary string `s`. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:

- **Type-1: Remove** the character at the start of the string `s` and **append** it to the end of the string.
- **Type-2: Pick** any character in `s` and **flip** its value, i.e., if its value is `'0'` it becomes `'1'` and vice-versa.

Return *the **minimum** number of **type-2** operations you need to perform* *such that* `s` *becomes **alternating**.*

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal.

- For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 2
Explanation: Use the first operation two times to make s = "100011".
Then, use the second operation on the third and sixth elements to make s = "101010".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: 1
Explanation: Use the second operation on the second element to make s = "1010".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minFlips(string s) {
        int n=s.size();
        vector<vector<int> > cnt(2, vector<int>(2, 0));

        
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            cnt[s[i]-'0'][i%2]++;
        }
        int ans=cnt[1][0]+cnt[0][1]; 
        ans=min(ans, cnt[0][0]+cnt[1][1]);
        for(int i=0; i<n; i++){
            cnt[s[i]-'0'][i%2]--;
            cnt[s[i]-'0'][(n+i)%2]++;
            ans=min(ans, cnt[1][0]+cnt[0][1]);
            ans=min(ans, cnt[0][0]+cnt[1][1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

cnt[1][0]+cnt[0][1] means making all 0 in even positions and all 1 in odd positions, cnt[0][0] + cnt[1][1] means making all 1 in even positions and all 0 in odd positions. 

Perform two types operation and continue check these two costs

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
