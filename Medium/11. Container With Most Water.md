**Problem:**

Given `n` non-negative integers `a1, a2, ..., an` , where each represents a point at coordinate `(i, ai)`. `n` vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line `i` is at `(i, ai)` and `(i, 0)`. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.



**Example 1:**

```
Input: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
Explanation: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [1,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: height = [4,3,2,1,4]
Output: 16
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: height = [1,2,1]
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 104` 




**My Solution: **
```
int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxarea = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            maxarea = max(maxarea, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                right--;
            }
            else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
```

Correctness:
This idea is like problem 1 Two Sum. First, we should set i and j as the left pointer and right pointer, separately. And then in the first step of searching, we should dicide how to move these two pointers.

Like the solution shown in problem 1, we should drop some value forever to reduce the multiply check. If heights[i] < heights[j], we can know that no matter how we change j, it's impossible to get a larger area than now, because the height is limited by heights[i]. It's the same with the situation when heights[i] > heights[j]. 

In that case, for each step of seaching, we should abandon the smaller one forever and continue to search next possible value.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
