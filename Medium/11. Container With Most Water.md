**Problem**:

Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

**Note:** You may not slant the container and *n* is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

**Example:**

```
Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49
```

**Solution**:

I used brute force way to work out this problem, using two loops.

The author's solution is that:

Put the first pointer i at the beginning of the array, and the second pointer j at the end of the array. Then count the area of [i, j]ï¼Œif it's bigger than "maxarea", then update "maxarea". Then, if height[i] < height[j], make i += 1, otherwise j -= 1.

To prove this, we assume that recent optimal range is [i, j], and height[i] < height[j].

If we move j to j - 1, then there are two situations. 

First, height[j - 1] >= height[i], because of the decrease of range[i, j] to range[i, j - 1], the area decreases. 

Second, height[j - 1] < height[i], we can see the height reduces, and the range also reduces.

So we can only move i to i + 1.

If height[i] > height[j], then we have to move j to j - 1.

If height[i] == height[j], we can move either i or j.

So the code is:

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxArea(vector<int>& height) {
        int maxarea = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = height.size() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            maxarea = max(maxarea, min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            if (height[left] > height[right]) {
                right--;
            }
            else {
                left++;
            }
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
};
```
