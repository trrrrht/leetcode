**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums` with no duplicates. A **maximum binary tree** can be built recursively from `nums` using the following algorithm:

1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in `nums`.
2. Recursively build the left subtree on the **subarray prefix** to the **left** of the maximum value.
3. Recursively build the right subtree on the **subarray suffix** to the **right** of the maximum value.

Return *the **maximum binary tree** built from* `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
Output: [6,3,5,null,2,0,null,null,1]
Explanation: The recursive calls are as follow:
- The largest value in [3,2,1,6,0,5] is 6. Left prefix is [3,2,1] and right suffix is [0,5].
    - The largest value in [3,2,1] is 3. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [2,1].
        - Empty array, so no child.
        - The largest value in [2,1] is 2. Left prefix is [] and right suffix is [1].
            - Empty array, so no child.
            - Only one element, so child is a node with value 1.
    - The largest value in [0,5] is 5. Left prefix is [0] and right suffix is [].
        - Only one element, so child is a node with value 0.
        - Empty array, so no child.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,null,2,null,1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- All integers in `nums` are **unique**.
**Other Solution:**
```
TreeNode* constructMaximumBinaryTree(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<TreeNode*> stk;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i)
        {
            TreeNode* cur = new TreeNode(nums[i]);
            while (!stk.empty() && stk.back()->val < nums[i])
            {
                cur->left = stk.back();
                stk.pop_back();
            }
            if (!stk.empty())
                stk.back()->right = cur;
            stk.push_back(cur);
        }
        return stk.front();
    }
```
Correctness:


We scan numbers from left to right, build the tree one node by one step;

We use a stack to keep some (not all) tree nodes and ensure a decreasing order;

For each number, we keep pop the stack until empty or a bigger number; The bigger number (if exist, it will be still in stack) is current number's root, and the last popped number (if exist) is current number's left child (temporarily, this relationship may change in the future); Then we push current number into the stack.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
