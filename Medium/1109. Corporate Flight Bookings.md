**Problem:**
There are `n` flights that are labeled from `1` to `n`.

You are given an array of flight bookings `bookings`, where `bookings[i] = [firsti, lasti, seatsi]` represents a booking for flights `firsti` through `lasti` (**inclusive**) with `seatsi` seats reserved for **each flight** in the range.

Return *an array* `answer` *of length* `n`*, where* `answer[i]` *is the total number of seats reserved for flight* `i`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,3,20],[2,5,25]], n = 5
Output: [10,55,45,25,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2   3   4   5
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      20  20
Booking 3 reserved:      25  25  25  25
Total seats:         10  55  45  25  25
Hence, answer = [10,55,45,25,25]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: bookings = [[1,2,10],[2,2,15]], n = 2
Output: [10,25]
Explanation:
Flight labels:        1   2
Booking 1 reserved:  10  10
Booking 2 reserved:      15
Total seats:         10  25
Hence, answer = [10,25]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
- `1 <= bookings.length <= 2 * 104`
- `bookings[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= firsti <= lasti <= n`
- `1 <= seatsi <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> corpFlightBookings(vector<vector<int>>& bookings, int n) {
        vector<int> res(n);
        for (const auto& v : bookings)
        {
            res[v[0] - 1] += v[2];
            if (v[1] < n)
            {
                res[v[1]] -= v[2];
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i)
        {
            res[i] += res[i - 1];
        }
        
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is based on prefix sum. We know we should add bookings[i][2] to the index from bookings[i][0] to bookings[i][1]. If we use a array to store the prefix sum where prefix[bookings[i][0]] stores bookings[i][2], we can then use prefix[i] += prefix[i - 1] to add bookings[i][2] from bookings[i][0] + 1 to bookings[i][1]. However, if we calculate prefix like this, we know for the prefix[bookings[i][1] + 1], we will add extra bookings[i][2], so we can substract bookings[i][2] for prefix[bookings[i][1] + 1]. After that, by performing prefix[i] += prefix[i -1], we can get the result.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
