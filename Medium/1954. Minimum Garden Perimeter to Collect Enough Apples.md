**Problem:**
In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at **every** integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate `(i, j)` has `|i| + |j|` apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned **square plot** of land that is centered at `(0, 0)`.

Given an integer `neededApples`, return *the **minimum perimeter** of a plot such that **at least*** `neededApples` *apples are **inside or on** the perimeter of that plot*.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

- `x` if `x >= 0`
- `-x` if `x < 0`

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/30/1527_example_1_2.png)

```
Input: neededApples = 1
Output: 8
Explanation: A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.
However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).
The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: neededApples = 13
Output: 16
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: neededApples = 1000000000
Output: 5040
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= neededApples <= 1015`
**Other Solution:**
```
long long minimumPerimeter(long long x) {
        long long l = 1,  r = 100000, m;
        while (l < r) {
            m = (l + r) / 2;
            if (m * m * m * 4 + m * m * 6 + m * 2 >= x)
                r = m;
            else
                l = m + 1;
        }
        return l * 8;
    }
```
Correctness:

We use binary search to find the boundary of the square

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
