**Problem:**
Given a `m x n` `grid` filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

**Note:** You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: 12
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

**My Solution:**
```
int minPathSum(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        vector<int> cost(grid[0].size());
        cost[0] = grid[0][0];
        for (int i = 1; i < grid[0].size(); i++) {
            cost[i] = cost[i - 1] + grid[0][i];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < grid.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].size(); j++) {
                if (j) {
                    cost[j] = min(cost[j] + grid[i][j], cost[j - 1] + grid[i][j]);
                }
                else {
                    cost[j] += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return cost[grid[0].size() - 1];
    }
```

Correctness:

This algorithm is like problem 62 Unique Path. We can find the minimum cost path by comparing the left or up path for current cell. And instead of using 2-dimension vector, we can use a 1-dimension vector to save the cost, because we have to iterate from 1 to n row and the left path is current index - 1, the up path is current index before update.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
