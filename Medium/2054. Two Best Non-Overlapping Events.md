**Problem:**
You are given a **0-indexed** 2D integer array of `events` where `events[i] = [startTimei, endTimei, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startTimei` and ends at `endTimei`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You can choose **at most** **two** **non-overlapping** events to attend such that the sum of their values is **maximized**.

Return *this **maximum** sum.*

Note that the start time and end time is **inclusive**: that is, you cannot attend two events where one of them starts and the other ends at the same time. More specifically, if you attend an event with end time `t`, the next event must start at or after `t + 1`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[2,4,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: Choose the green events, 0 and 1 for a sum of 2 + 2 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

![Example 1 Diagram](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/21/picture1.png)

```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[1,5,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose event 2 for a sum of 5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: events = [[1,5,3],[1,5,1],[6,6,5]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Choose events 0 and 2 for a sum of 3 + 5 = 8.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= events.length <= 105`
- `events[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= startTimei <= endTimei <= 109`
- `1 <= valuei <= 106`
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxTwoEvents(vector<vector<int>>& e) {
        int size=e.size(),ans=0,maxi=0;
        sort(e.begin(),e.end());
        map<int,int>mp;
        while(size--){
            auto it=mp.upper_bound(e[size][1]);
            maxi=max(maxi,e[size][2]);
              mp[e[size][0]]=maxi;
            if(it==mp.end())
                ans=max(ans,maxi);
            else
                ans=max(ans,e[size][2]+it->second);
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just use binary search to find the next maximum value. Since the array is sorted, each time, the max value could only be close to the end of the array. Or do this reversely.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
