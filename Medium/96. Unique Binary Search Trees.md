**Problem:**
Given an integer `n`, return *the number of structurally unique **BST'**s (binary search trees) which has exactly* `n` *nodes of unique values from* `1` *to* `n`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 19`
**Other Solution:**
```
int numTrees(int n) {
        vector<int> G(n + 1);
        G[0] = G[1] = 1;
        for(int i=2; i<=n; ++i) {
            for(int j=1; j<=i; ++j) {
                G[i] += G[j-1] * G[i-j];
            }
        }
        return G[n];
    }
```
Correctness:

Let's denote G(n) is the number of unique BST for a sequence of length n, F(i, n) is the number of unique BST, where the number i is the root of BST and the sequence ranges from 1 to n. We can know from the denotation that G(n) = F(1, n) + F(2, n) + ... + F(n, n). The initial state is G(0) = 1, G(1) = 1.

For F(i, n), we use F(3, 7) as an example. If we pick 3 as the root node, and the sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], we will know the left sub-tree is formed by [1, 2] and the right is formed by [4, 5, 6, 7]. The number of sub-tree that [1, 2] could form is G(2), while that of [4, 5, 6, 7] is G(4), which means F(i, n) = G(i - 1) * G(n - i)

To sum up, G(n) = G(0) * G(n - 1) + G(1) * G(n - 2) + ... + G(n - 1) * G(0)

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
