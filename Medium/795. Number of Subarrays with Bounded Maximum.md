**Problem:**
We are given an array `A` of positive integers, and two positive integers `L` and `R` (`L <= R`).

Return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays such that the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is at least `L` and at most `R`.

```
Example :
Input: 
A = [2, 1, 4, 3]
L = 2
R = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the requirements: [2], [2, 1], [3].
```

**Note:**

- L, R and `A[i]` will be an integer in the range `[0, 10^9]`.
- The length of `A` will be in the range of `[1, 50000]`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int numSubarrayBoundedMax(vector<int>& A, int L, int R) {
        int left = -1;
        int subarray = 0;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); i++) {
            if (A[i] < L) {
                count += subarray;
            }
            else if (A[i] > R) {
                left = i;
                subarray = 0;
            }
            else {
                subarray = i - left;
                count += subarray;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each i, A[i] could only in the range of (-inf, L), [L, R], or (R, +inf), so we should consider what will happen when A[i] is in these ranges, separately.

First, we should use a variable called subarray to save the number of the subarray that satisfies the requirement of the problem. 

When A[i] is smaller than L, we know the continuous array ending with index i have the same subarray with A[i - 1], since A[i] could not be the maximum number in this array and it can also be alone in a array that satisfies the requirement.

When A[i] is larger than R, we know the continuous array ending with index i could not be continue. In this case, we should set the left boundary of the subarray as i.

When A[i] is in [L, R], we know the continuous array ending with index i have i - left subarray that satisfies the requirement (in (left, i], all the number is smaller than or equal to R).

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
