**Problem:**
You are given an array representing a row of `seats` where `seats[i] = 1` represents a person sitting in the `ith` seat, and `seats[i] = 0` represents that the `ith` seat is empty **(0-indexed)**.

There is at least one empty seat, and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance between him and the closest person to him is maximized. 

Return *that maximum distance to the closest person*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/10/distance.jpg)

```
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e. seats[2]), then the closest person has distance 2.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person has distance 1.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the last seat (i.e. seats[3]), the closest person is 3 seats away.
This is the maximum distance possible, so the answer is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: seats = [0,1]
Output: 1
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= seats.length <= 2 * 104`
- `seats[i]` is `0` or `1`.
- At least one seat is **empty**.
- At least one seat is **occupied**.
**My Solution:**
```
int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int index = - 3 * 10e4;
        for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {
            if (seats[i] == 1) {
                index = i;
                seats[i] = -1;
            }
            else {
                seats[i] = i - index;
            }
        }
        index = 3 * 10e4;
        int distance = 0;
        for (int i = seats.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (seats[i] == -1) {
                index = i;
            }
            else {
                distance = max(distance, min(seats[i], index - i));
            }
        }
        return distance;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to find the maximum distance to the cloest person, we can save an array for the distance between the blank seat and the cloest person(both sides).

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
**Other Solution 1:**
This idea is like the one before. Instead of using array to save the distance of all the closest person, we use two pointers to remark the left and right cloest persons. Pay attention  to the prev and future. If prev == -1, it means no person at the left, so the distance is infinite. So does the future == size.
```
int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int size = seats.size();
        int prev = -1;
        int future = 0;
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (seats[i]) {
                prev = i;
            }
            else {
                while (future < size && !seats[future] || future < i) {
                    future++;
                }
                int left = prev == -1 ? size : i - prev;
                int right = future == size ? size: future - i;
                result = max(result, min(left, right));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
**Other Solution 2:**
```
int maxDistToClosest(vector<int>& seats) {
        int dist = 0;
        int zero = 0;
        int size = seats.size();
        while (seats[dist] == 0) {
            ++dist;
        }
        zero = 0;
        for (int i = dist + 1; i < size; ++i) {
            if (seats[i] == 0) {
                ++zero;
            } else {
                dist = max(dist, (zero + 1) / 2);
                zero = 0;
            }
        }
        return max(dist, zero);
    }
```
Correctness:

As we know from the question, the maximum distance of the cloest person must be $\frac{k + 1}{2}$, where k is the consecutive empty seats. And if there's no seat at the left or right side of the empty seats, the maximum will be k, so we can get the result by counting zero.

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
