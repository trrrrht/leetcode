**Problem:**
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return *the length of their longest **common subsequence**.* If there is no **common subsequence**, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

- For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.

A **common subsequence** of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= text1.length, text2.length <= 1000`
- `text1` and `text2` consist of only lowercase English characters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestCommonSubsequence(string &a, string &b) {
      vector<vector<short>> m(a.size() + 1, vector<short>(b.size() + 1));
      for (auto i = 1; i <= a.size(); ++i)
        for (auto j = 1; j <= b.size(); ++j)
          if (a[i - 1] == b[j - 1]) m[i][j] = m[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
          else m[i][j] = max(m[i - 1][j], m[i][j - 1]);
      return m[a.size()][b.size()];
    }
```
