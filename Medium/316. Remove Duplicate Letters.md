**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is **the smallest in lexicographical order** among all possible results.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

 

**Note:** This question is the same as 1081: https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subsequence-of-distinct-characters/
**Other Solution:**
```
string removeDuplicateLetters(string s) {
        vector<int> cand(256, 0);
        vector<bool> visited(256, false);
        for (char c : s)
            cand[c]++;
        string result = "0";
        for (char c : s) {
            cand[c]--;
            if (visited[c]) continue;
            while (c < result.back() && cand[result.back()]) {
                visited[result.back()] = false;
                result.pop_back();
            }
            result += c;
            visited[c] = true;
        }
        return result.substr(1);
    }
```
Correctness:

For each char, check the chars before it. If they are larger then current char and there are more of them, pop them and push current char

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
