**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` which represents a permutation of all the integers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

The number of **global inversions** is the number of the different pairs `(i, j)` where:

- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `nums[i] > nums[j]`

The number of **local inversions** is the number of indices `i` where:

- `0 <= i < n - 1`
- `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`

Return `true` *if the number of **global inversions** is equal to the number of **local inversions***.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is 1 global inversion and 1 local inversion.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: false
Explanation: There are 2 global inversions and 1 local inversion.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= nums[i] < n`
- All the integers of `nums` are **unique**.
- `nums` is a permutation of all the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& A) {
        int leftmax = A[0];
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < A.size(); i++) {
            if (leftmax > A[i] && index != i - 1) {
                return false;
            } 
            if (leftmax < A[i - 1]) {
                leftmax = A[i - 1];
                index = i - 1;
            }
            
        }
        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

We don't need to calculate the numbers of global inversions and local inversions, since we know, if there's a local inversion, there must be a global inversion. What we should do is to check whether there is i and j that satisfy i < j - 1 && nums[i] > nums[j].

Also, since we want to find the number i which is larger than j, we can just try to find the left max number. However, it may exist at index j - 1 and it will update before we check whether we should return false. In this case, we can check the left max number before index j - 1.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
**Other Solution:**
Since the range of the number is [0, size - 1], we can just check the distance that a value is from its index.
```
bool isIdealPermutation(vector<int>& A) {
        for (int i = 0; i < A.size(); ++i) {
            if (abs(i - A[i]) > 1) return false; 
        }
        return true; 
    }
```
