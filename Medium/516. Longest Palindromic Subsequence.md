**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, find *the longest palindromic **subsequence**'s length in* `s`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "bbbab"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "cbbd"
Output: 2
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bb".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestPalindromeSubseq(string s) {
        int n = s.size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int>(n));
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (s[i] == s[j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[0][n-1];
    }
```
Correctness:

For each char in the string, we should check the left sequence and right sequence of it to see whether it's a palindrome

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
