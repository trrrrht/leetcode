**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= 100`
- `0 <= prices.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int maxProfit(vector<int>& p, int res = 0) {
      for (int i = 1; i < p.size(); ++i) res += max(0, p[i] - p[i - 1]);
      return res;
    }
    int maxProfit(int k, vector<int>& prices) {
      if (k >= prices.size() / 2) return maxProfit(prices);
      vector<int> buys(k + 1, INT_MIN), sells(k + 1, 0);
      for (auto p : prices)
        for (auto i = 1; i <= k; ++i) {
          buys[i] = max(buys[i], sells[i - 1] - p);
          sells[i] = max(sells[i], buys[i] + p);  
        }
      return sells[k];
    }
```
Correctness:

This algorithm is exactly like Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
