**Problem:**
Bob is standing at cell `(0, 0)`, and he wants to reach `destination`: `(row, column)`. He can only travel **right** and **down**. You are going to help Bob by providing **instructions** for him to reach `destination`.

The **instructions** are represented as a string, where each character is either:

- `'H'`, meaning move horizontally (go **right**), or
- `'V'`, meaning move vertically (go **down**).

Multiple **instructions** will lead Bob to `destination`. For example, if `destination` is `(2, 3)`, both `"HHHVV"` and `"HVHVH"` are valid **instructions**.

However, Bob is very picky. Bob has a lucky number `k`, and he wants the `kth` **lexicographically smallest instructions** that will lead him to `destination`. `k` is **1-indexed**.

Given an integer array `destination` and an integer `k`, return *the* `kth` ***lexicographically smallest instructions** that will take Bob to* `destination`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex1.png)

```
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 1
Output: "HHHVV"
Explanation: All the instructions that reach (2, 3) in lexicographic order are as follows:
["HHHVV", "HHVHV", "HHVVH", "HVHHV", "HVHVH", "HVVHH", "VHHHV", "VHHVH", "VHVHH", "VVHHH"].
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex2.png)**

```
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 2
Output: "HHVHV"
```

**Example 3:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/12/ex3.png)**

```
Input: destination = [2,3], k = 3
Output: "HHVVH"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `destination.length == 2`
- `1 <= row, column <= 15`
- `1 <= k <= nCr(row + column, row)`, where `nCr(a, b)` denotes `a` choose `b`.
**Other Solution:**
```
size_t NChooseK(int n, int k) {
        return round(tgamma(n+1)/tgamma(k+1)/tgamma(n-k+1));
    }
    
    string kthSmallestPath(vector<int>& destination, int k) {
        int numHLeft = destination[1], numCharsToBuild = destination[0] + destination[1];
        uint64_t totalMax = NChooseK(numCharsToBuild, numHLeft);
        string ans = "";
        while (numHLeft && numHLeft < numCharsToBuild) {
            uint64_t maxH = totalMax*numHLeft/numCharsToBuild;
            if (k <= maxH) {
                ans += "H";
                numHLeft--;
                totalMax = maxH;
            } else {
                ans += "V";
                totalMax -= maxH;
				k -= maxH;
            }
            numCharsToBuild--;
        }
        ans += string(numCharsToBuild, numHLeft ? 'H' : 'V');
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each step, we use combination to calculate the remaining step and decide the next step
