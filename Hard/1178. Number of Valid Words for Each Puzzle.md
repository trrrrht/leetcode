**Problem:**
With respect to a given `puzzle` string, a `word` is *valid* if both the following conditions are satisfied:

- `word` contains the first letter of `puzzle`.
- For each letter in `word`, that letter is in `puzzle`.
  For example, if the puzzle is "abcdefg", then valid words are "faced", "cabbage", and "baggage"; while invalid words are "beefed" (doesn't include "a") and "based" (includes "s" which isn't in the puzzle).

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of words in the given word list `words` that are valid with respect to the puzzle `puzzles[i]`.

 

**Example :**

```
Input: 
words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"], 
puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
Explanation:
1 valid word for "aboveyz" : "aaaa" 
1 valid word for "abrodyz" : "aaaa"
3 valid words for "abslute" : "aaaa", "asas", "able"
2 valid words for "absoryz" : "aaaa", "asas"
4 valid words for "actresz" : "aaaa", "asas", "actt", "access"
There're no valid words for "gaswxyz" cause none of the words in the list contains letter 'g'.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
- `4 <= words[i].length <= 50`
- `1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`
- `puzzles[i].length == 7`
- `words[i][j]`, `puzzles[i][j]` are English lowercase letters.
- Each `puzzles[i] `doesn't contain repeated characters.
**Other Solution:**
```
    int bits(const std::string &s) {
        int bs = 0;
        for (auto c : s) bs |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        return bs;
    }
    
public:
    vector<int> findNumOfValidWords(vector<string>& words, vector<string>& puzzles) {
		vector<int> res;
        unordered_map<int, int> fq;
        for (auto &w : words) {
            ++fq[bits(w)];
        }
        
        for (auto &w : puzzles) {
            int mask = bits(w);
            int num = 0;
            
            int fb = 1 << (w[0] - 'a');
            for (int cur = mask; cur; cur = (cur - 1) & mask) {
                if (!(cur & fb)) continue;
                const auto &it = fq.find(cur);
                if (it != fq.cend()) num += it->second;
            }
            
            res.push_back(num);
        }

		return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since the number of the chars is only 26, we could use 32-bit integers to represent all of them to save space. After mapping, for each words, we just have to check whether they are masked by the puzzles

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
