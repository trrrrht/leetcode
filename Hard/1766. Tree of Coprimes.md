**Problem:**
There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the **root** of the tree is node `0`.

To represent this tree, you are given an integer array `nums` and a 2D array `edges`. Each `nums[i]` represents the `ith` node's value, and each `edges[j] = [uj, vj]` represents an edge between nodes `uj` and `vj` in the tree.

Two values `x` and `y` are **coprime** if `gcd(x, y) == 1` where `gcd(x, y)` is the **greatest common divisor** of `x` and `y`.

An ancestor of a node `i` is any other node on the shortest path from node `i` to the **root**. A node is **not** considered an ancestor of itself.

Return *an array* `ans` *of size* `n`, *where* `ans[i]` *is the closest ancestor to node* `i` *such that* `nums[i]` *and* `nums[ans[i]]` are **coprime**, or `-1` *if there is no such ancestor*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [-1,0,0,1]
Explanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.
- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.
- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).
- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.
- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its
  closest valid ancestor.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/06/untitled-diagram1.png)

```
Input: nums = [5,6,10,2,3,6,15], edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]]
Output: [-1,0,-1,0,0,0,-1]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `nums.length == n`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 50`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `edges[j].length == 2`
- `0 <= uj, vj < n`
- `uj != vj`
**Other Solution:**
```
unordered_map<int, vector<int>> cops;
    unordered_map<int, vector<pair<int, int>>> ancestors;
    void traverse(vector<int>& n, vector<vector<int>> &al, int i, int parent, int level, vector<int> &res) {
        int max_level = -1;
        for (auto cop : cops[n[i]]) {
            auto &v = ancestors[cop];
            if (!v.empty() && v.back().first > max_level) {
                max_level = v.back().first;
                res[i] = v.back().second;
            }
        }
        ancestors[n[i]].push_back({level, i});
        for (auto child : al[i])
            if (child != parent)
                traverse(n, al, child, i, level + 1, res);
        ancestors[n[i]].pop_back();
    }
    vector<int> getCoprimes(vector<int>& n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        unordered_set<int> s(begin(n), end(n));
        for (auto n1 : s) {
            for (auto n2 : s)
                if (__gcd(n1, n2) == 1)
                    cops[n1].push_back(n2);
        }
        vector<vector<int>> al(n.size());
        vector<int> res(n.size(), -1);
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            al[e[0]].push_back(e[1]);
            al[e[1]].push_back(e[0]);
        }
        traverse(n, al, 0, 0, 0, res);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since the max number of nodes is 50, we should check at most 50 ancestors for each node. In this case, we just have to save all the co-primes for each number and iterate the tree to find the cloest

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
