**Problem:**
A delivery company wants to build a new service centre in a new city. The company knows the positions of all the customers in this city on a 2D-Map and wants to build the new centre in a position such that **the sum of the euclidean distances to all customers is minimum**.

Given an array `positions` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` is the position of the `ith` customer on the map, return *the minimum sum of the euclidean distances* to all customers.

In other words, you need to choose the position of the service centre `[xcentre, ycentre]` such that the following formula is minimized:

Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]
Output: 2.82843
Explanation: The minimum possible sum of distances = sqrt(2) + sqrt(2) = 2.82843
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: positions = [[1,1]]
Output: 0.00000
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: positions = [[1,1],[0,0],[2,0]]
Output: 2.73205
Explanation: At the first glance, you may think that locating the centre at [1, 0] will achieve the minimum sum, but locating it at [1, 0] will make the sum of distances = 3.
Try to locate the centre at [1.0, 0.5773502711] you will see that the sum of distances is 2.73205.
Be careful with the precision!
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: positions = [[0,1],[3,2],[4,5],[7,6],[8,9],[11,1],[2,12]]
Output: 32.94036
Explanation: You can use [4.3460852395, 4.9813795505] as the position of the centre.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= positions.length <= 50`
- `positions[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 100`
**Other Solution:**
```
double getMinDistSum(vector<vector<int>>& pos) {
        double left = 100, bottom = 100, right = 0, top = 0;
        for (auto &p : pos) {
            left = min(left, (double)p[0]);
            bottom = min(bottom, (double)p[1]);
            right = max(right, (double)p[0]);
            top = max(top, (double)p[1]);
        }
        double res = DBL_MAX, res_x = 0, res_y = 0;
        for (double delta = 10; delta >= 0.00001; delta /= 10) {
            for (double x = left; x <= right; x += delta)
                for (double y = bottom; y <= top; y += delta) {
                    double d = 0;
                    for (auto &p : pos)
                        d += sqrt((p[0] - x) * (p[0] - x) + (p[1] - y) * (p[1] - y));
                    if (res > d) {
                        res = d;
                        res_x = x;
                        res_y = y;
                    }
                }
            left = res_x - delta;
            bottom = res_y - delta;
            right = res_x + delta * 2;
            top = res_y + delta * 2;
        }
        return res == DBL_MAX ? 0 : res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Convert this map to a n * n grid, and search each cell that satisfies the requirement

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
