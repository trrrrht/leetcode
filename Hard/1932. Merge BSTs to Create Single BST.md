**Problem:**
You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

- Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.
- Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
- Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.

Return *the **root** of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing* `n - 1` *operations, or* `null` *if it is impossible to create a valid BST*.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:

- Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.
- Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.

A leaf is a node that has no children.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d1.png)

```
Input: trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]
Output: [3,2,5,1,null,4]
Explanation:
In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].

In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].

The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d2.png)

```
Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
Output: []
Explanation:
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].

The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d3.png)

```
Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]
Output: []
Explanation: It is impossible to perform any operations.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == trees.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
- Each node in the input may have children but no grandchildren.
- No two roots of `trees` have the same value.
- All the trees in the input are **valid BSTs**.
- `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 104`.
**Other Solution:**
```
unordered_map<int, TreeNode*> rootmap;
    unordered_set<int> leafmap;

    TreeNode* canMerge(vector<TreeNode*>& trees) {

        for(auto it : trees) {
            rootmap[it->val] = it;
            if(it->left)
                leafmap.insert(it->left->val);
            if(it->right)
                leafmap.insert(it->right->val);
        }
        TreeNode* root = nullptr;
        for(auto it : trees) {
            if(leafmap.find(it->val) == leafmap.end())
                root = it;
        }
        if(helper(root, INT_MIN, INT_MAX)) {
            if(rootmap.size() == 1)
                return root;
        }
        return nullptr;
    }

    bool helper(TreeNode* root, int low, int high) {
        if(!root)
            return true;
        if(root->val >= high || root->val <= low)
            return false;    
        if(root->left) {
            int cur = root->left->val;
            if(rootmap.find(cur) != rootmap.end()) {
                root->left = rootmap[cur];
                rootmap.erase(cur);
            }
        }

        if(root->right) {
            int cur = root->right->val;
            if(rootmap.find(cur) != rootmap.end()) {
                root->right = rootmap[cur];
                rootmap.erase(cur);
            }            
        }

         if(!helper(root->left, low, root->val))
            return false;

        if(!helper(root->right, root->val, high))
            return false;


        return true;
    }
```
Correctness:

Populate a hashmap {value: root} . All root values are guaranteed to be unique.

Count values among all trees.

Identify a root of the combined tree; it's value must be counted only once.

Traverse from the root:

Check BST validity, like inÂ 98. Validate Binary Search Tree.

Join leaves with roots, matching leaf and root value using the map.

If the combined tree is valid, and it includes all roots - return the root of the combined tree.
