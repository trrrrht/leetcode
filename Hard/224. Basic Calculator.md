**Problem:**
Given a string `s` representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return *the result of the evaluation*.

**Note:** You are **not** allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as `eval()`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105`
- `s` consists of digits, `'+'`, `'-'`, `'('`, `')'`, and `' '`.
- `s` represents a valid expression.
- `'+'` is not used as a unary operation.
- `'-'` could be used as a unary operation but it has to be followed by parentheses.
- Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.
**Other Solution:**
```
int calculate(string s) {
        stack<int> op({1});
        int total = 0, num = 0;
        int isPositive = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                num = num * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else {
                total += num * isPositive * op.top();
                num = 0;
                if (c == '+') isPositive = 1;
                if (c == '-') isPositive = -1;
                if (c == ')') op.pop();
                if (c == '(') {
                    op.push(op.top() * isPositive);
                    isPositive = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        total += num * isPositive * op.top();
        return total;
    }
```
Correctness:

Just do it as reverse polish notation

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
