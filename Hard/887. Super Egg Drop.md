**Problem:**
You are given `k` identical eggs and you have access to a building with `n` floors labeled from `1` to `n`.

You know that there exists a floor `f` where `0 <= f <= n` such that any egg dropped at a floor **higher** than `f` will **break**, and any egg dropped **at or below** floor `f` will **not break**.

Each move, you may take an unbroken egg and drop it from any floor `x` (where `1 <= x <= n`). If the egg breaks, you can no longer use it. However, if the egg does not break, you may **reuse** it in future moves.

Return *the **minimum number of moves** that you need to determine **with certainty** what the value of* `f` is.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 1, n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: 
Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know that f = 0.
Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know that f = 1.
If it does not break, then we know f = 2.
Hence, we need at minimum 2 moves to determine with certainty what the value of f is.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 2, n = 6
Output: 3
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 3, n = 14
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
        vector<int> dp(K + 1, 0);
        int m;
        for (m = 0; dp[K] < N; m++)
            for (int k = K; k > 0; --k)
                dp[k] += dp[k - 1] + 1;
        return m;
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[m][k] represents with k eggs and m moves, the maximum number of floor we could check. In this case, dp[m][k] = dp[m - 1][k - 1] + dp[m - 1][k] + 1, which means if egg breaks, with 1 move, we can check dp[m - 1][k - 1] floors, if egg doesn't break, we can check dp[m - 1][k] floors. We can also reduce this space to 1D array

Complexity:

Time: O(klogn)
Space: O(k)
