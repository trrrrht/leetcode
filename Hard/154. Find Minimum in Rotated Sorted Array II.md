**Problem:**
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,4]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,4,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain **duplicates**, return *the minimum element of this array*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `-5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000`
- `nums` is sorted and rotated between `1` and `n` times.

 

**Follow up:** This is the same as [Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/description/) but with duplicates. Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
**My Solution:**
```
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums.size() - 1;
        if (high == 0) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        if (nums[high] > nums[low]) {
            return nums[0];
        }
        while (high >= low) {
            while (low < high && nums[low] == nums[low + 1]) {
                low++;
            }
            while (low < high && nums[high] == nums[high - 1]) {
                high--;
            }
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (mid + 1 < nums.size() && nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
                return nums[mid + 1];
            }
            if (mid - 1 >= 0 && nums[mid - 1] > nums[mid]) {
                return nums[mid];
            }
            if (nums[mid] > nums[0]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
```
Correctness:

This algorithm is similar to problem 153 Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array but we have to deal with the duplicate number. And after skipping them, we may not find the smallest number since all the number are the same in this array. In that case, we should return nums[low] as default.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)

**Other Solution:**
Also, we can change the form of the algorithm before by simplely decrease high to avoid duplicate number and return nums[low]. We have discussed why we should return nums[low] in problem 35 Search Insert Position
```
int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1;
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[high]) {
                high = mid;
            }
            else if (nums[mid] > nums[high]) {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
            else {
                high--;
            }
        }
        return nums[low];
    }
