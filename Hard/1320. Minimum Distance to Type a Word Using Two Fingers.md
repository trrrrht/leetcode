**Problem:**
![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/01/02/leetcode_keyboard.png)

You have a keyboard layout as shown above in the **X-Y** plane, where each English uppercase letter is located at some coordinate.

- For example, the letter `'A'` is located at coordinate `(0, 0)`, the letter `'B'` is located at coordinate `(0, 1)`, the letter `'P'` is located at coordinate `(2, 3)` and the letter `'Z'` is located at coordinate `(4, 1)`.

Given the string `word`, return *the minimum total **distance** to type such string using only two fingers*.

The **distance** between coordinates `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

**Note** that the initial positions of your two fingers are considered free so do not count towards your total distance, also your two fingers do not have to start at the first letter or the first two letters.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word = "CAKE"
Output: 3
Explanation: Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "CAKE" is: 
Finger 1 on letter 'C' -> cost = 0 
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'C' to letter 'A' = 2 
Finger 2 on letter 'K' -> cost = 0 
Finger 2 on letter 'E' -> cost = Distance from letter 'K' to letter 'E' = 1 
Total distance = 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word = "HAPPY"
Output: 6
Explanation: Using two fingers, one optimal way to type "HAPPY" is:
Finger 1 on letter 'H' -> cost = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'A' -> cost = Distance from letter 'H' to letter 'A' = 2
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = 0
Finger 2 on letter 'P' -> cost = Distance from letter 'P' to letter 'P' = 0
Finger 1 on letter 'Y' -> cost = Distance from letter 'A' to letter 'Y' = 4
Total distance = 6
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= word.length <= 300`
- `word` consists of uppercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minimumDistance(string word) {
        vector<int> dp(26);
        int res = 0, save = 0, n = word.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            int b = word[i] - 'A', c = word[i + 1] - 'A';
            for (int a = 0; a < 26; ++a)
                dp[b] = max(dp[b], dp[a] + d(b, c) - d(a, c));
            save = max(save, dp[b]);
            res += d(b, c);
        }
        return res - save;
    }

    int d(int a, int b) {
        return abs(a / 6 - b / 6) + abs(a % 6 - b % 6);
    }
```
Correctness:


Imagine that we tap all letters with only one finger.
The res distance we get is the maximum distance we will need.In our dynamic programming, dp[a] means that,
if our left finger ends at character a,
the maximum we can save is dp[a].Now our right finger tapped all letters, and left finger did nothing.
We iterate through the whole string one by one
and select some letter to tap with the left finger.
By doing this, we want to find out the maximum distance that we can save from the tapping with one finger.Assume that our left finger is at a now,
our right finger is at b,
and we the right finger will tap c next.Instead of moving right finger from b to c with distance d(b, c),
we try moving left finger from a to c with distance d(a, c).
Hopely this will save d(b, c) - d(a, c).And finaly, we have one fingers at b and the other at c now.
The finger at b will be new left finger, and the other will be the rihgt.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
