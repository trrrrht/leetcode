**Problem:**
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with **Alice starting first**.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is **more than one**, they will do the following:

1. Choose an integer `x > 1`, and **remove** the leftmost `x` stones from the row.
2. Add the **sum** of the **removed** stones' values to the player's score.
3. Place a **new stone**, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when **only** **one** stone is left in the row.

The **score difference** between Alice and Bob is `(Alice's score - Bob's score)`. Alice's goal is to **maximize** the score difference, and Bob's goal is the **minimize** the score difference.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `ith` stone **from the left**, return *the **score difference** between Alice and Bob if they both play **optimally**.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: stones = [-1,2,-3,4,-5]
Output: 5
Explanation:
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on
  the left. stones = [-3].
The difference between their scores is 2 - (-3) = 5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: stones = [7,-6,5,10,5,-2,-6]
Output: 13
Explanation:
- Alice removes all stones, adds 7 + (-6) + 5 + 10 + 5 + (-2) + (-6) = 13 to her score, and places a
  stone of value 13 on the left. stones = [13].
The difference between their scores is 13 - 0 = 13.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: stones = [-10,-12]
Output: -22
Explanation:
- Alice can only make one move, which is to remove both stones. She adds (-10) + (-12) = -22 to her
  score and places a stone of value -22 on the left. stones = [-22].
The difference between their scores is (-22) - 0 = -22.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == stones.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `-104 <= stones[i] <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int stoneGameVIII(vector<int>& A) {
        int N = A.size();
        for (int i = 1; i < N; ++i) A[i] += A[i - 1]; 
		int dp = A.back(); 
        for (int i = N - 2; i > 0; --i) dp = max(dp, A[i] - dp);
        return dp;
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i] is the maximum score difference the current player can get when the game starts at i. And stones [0, i] are already merged as a new stone i whose value is prefix[i]. 

Assume the current player chooses to merge stones [0, j], the other one could get is dp[j], so the difference is prefix[i] - dp[j].

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
