**Problem:**
A city's **skyline** is the outer contour of the silhouette formed by all the buildings in that city when viewed from a distance. Given the locations and heights of all the buildings, return *the **skyline** formed by these buildings collectively*.

The geometric information of each building is given in the array `buildings` where `buildings[i] = [lefti, righti, heighti]`:

- `lefti` is the x coordinate of the left edge of the `ith` building.
- `righti` is the x coordinate of the right edge of the `ith` building.
- `heighti` is the height of the `ith` building.

You may assume all buildings are perfect rectangles grounded on an absolutely flat surface at height `0`.

The **skyline** should be represented as a list of "key points" **sorted by their x-coordinate** in the form `[[x1,y1],[x2,y2],...]`. Each key point is the left endpoint of some horizontal segment in the skyline except the last point in the list, which always has a y-coordinate `0` and is used to mark the skyline's termination where the rightmost building ends. Any ground between the leftmost and rightmost buildings should be part of the skyline's contour.

**Note:** There must be no consecutive horizontal lines of equal height in the output skyline. For instance, `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[7 5],[11 5],[12 7],...]` is not acceptable; the three lines of height 5 should be merged into one in the final output as such: `[...,[2 3],[4 5],[12 7],...]`

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/12/01/merged.jpg)

```
Input: buildings = [[2,9,10],[3,7,15],[5,12,12],[15,20,10],[19,24,8]]
Output: [[2,10],[3,15],[7,12],[12,0],[15,10],[20,8],[24,0]]
Explanation:
Figure A shows the buildings of the input.
Figure B shows the skyline formed by those buildings. The red points in figure B represent the key points in the output list.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: buildings = [[0,2,3],[2,5,3]]
Output: [[0,3],[5,0]]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= buildings.length <= 104`
- `0 <= lefti < righti <= 231 - 1`
- `1 <= heighti <= 231 - 1`
- `buildings` is sorted by `lefti` in non-decreasing order.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<vector<int>> getSkyline(vector<vector<int>>& v) {
         map<int,vector<pair<int,int>>>map;
        for(auto x:v){
            map[x[0]].push_back({x[2],1});
            map[x[1]].push_back({x[2],0});
        }
        multiset<int>set;
        vector<vector<int>>res;
        for(auto &x:map){
            for(auto y:x.second){
                if(y.second==1){
                    set.insert(y.first);
                }
                else{
                    if(set.find(y.first)!=set.end())
                        set.erase(set.find(y.first));
                }
            }
            int height=set.empty()?0:*set.rbegin();
            if(res.empty()){
                res.push_back({x.first,height});
            }
            else {
                if(res.back()[1]!=height){
                    res.push_back({x.first,height});
                }
            } 


        }
        return res;

    }
```
Correctness:


In map, 1 for the starting, 0 for the ending point.


now we have to do one operation is that if their is change in height after we processed a building than we have to change in our data so to do so we will use a multiset, we can also use a map and keep a eye on the occurences


Then reduce occurence if a building is produce, else it will increase occurences


After doing so if our maxheight is changed thats going to be in our answer

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
