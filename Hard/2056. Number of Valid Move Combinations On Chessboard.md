**Problem:**
There is an `8 x 8` chessboard containing `n` pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array `pieces` of length `n`, where `pieces[i]` describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the `ith` piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array `positions` also of length `n`, where `positions[i] = [ri, ci]` indicates that the `ith` piece is currently at the **1-based** coordinate `(ri, ci)` on the chessboard.

When making a **move** for a piece, you choose a **destination** square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

- A rook can only travel **horizontally or vertically** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, or `(r, c-1)`.
- A queen can only travel **horizontally, vertically, or diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c)`, `(r-1, c)`, `(r, c+1)`, `(r, c-1)`, `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.
- A bishop can only travel **diagonally** from `(r, c)` to the direction of `(r+1, c+1)`, `(r+1, c-1)`, `(r-1, c+1)`, `(r-1, c-1)`.

You must make a **move** for every piece on the board simultaneously. A **move combination** consists of all the **moves** performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel **one square** towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the `0th` second. A move combination is **invalid** if, at a given time, **two or more** pieces occupy the same square.

Return *the number of **valid** move combinations*.

**Notes:**

- **No two pieces** will start in the **same** square.
- You may choose the square a piece is already on as its **destination**.
- If two pieces are **directly adjacent** to each other, it is valid for them to **move past each other** and swap positions in one second.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: pieces = ["queen"], positions = [[1,1]]
Output: 22

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: pieces = ["bishop"], positions = [[4,3]]
Output: 12

```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == pieces.length`
- `n == positions.length`
- `1 <= n <= 4`
- `pieces` only contains the strings `"rook"`, `"queen"`, and `"bishop"`.
- There will be at most one queen on the chessboard.
- `1 <= xi, yi <= 8`
- Each `positions[i]` is distinct.
**Other Solution:**
```
public:
    int dir[8][2] = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, -1}, {-1, 1}};
    int b[4][8][8] = {};
    int countCombinations(vector<string>& pieces, vector<vector<int>>& pos, int p = 0) {
        if (p >= pieces.size())
            return 1;
        int i = pos[p][0] - 1, j = pos[p][1] - 1, res = 0;
        for (int d = 0; d < 8; ++d) {
            if ((d < 4 && pieces[p] == "bishop" ) || (d >= 4 && pieces[p] == "rook"))
                continue;
            bool blocked = false;
            for (int step = res == 0 ? 1 : 2; !blocked; ++step) {
                int x = i + (step - 1) * dir[d][0], y = j + (step - 1) * dir[d][1];
                if (min(x, y) < 0 || max(x, y) > 7)
                    break;
                bool canStop = true;
                for (int pp = 0; pp < p; ++pp) {
                    canStop &= b[pp][x][y] >= 0 && b[pp][x][y] < step;
                    blocked |= (b[pp][x][y] < 0 && -b[pp][x][y] <= step) || (b[pp][x][y] == step);
                }
                if (canStop) {
                    b[p][x][y] = -step;
                    res += countCombinations(pieces, pos, p + 1);
                }
                b[p][x][y] = step;
            }
            fill_n(b[p][0], 64, 0);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


For a move, we need to track both transitional and final positions.
For each position, we track the number of steps to get there.To indicate the final position, we will use a negative number of steps.

We need to track moves independently for all pieces.

A position is blocked if it is:
a final one for another piece with smaller/same number of steps to get there, ora transitional position for another piece with the same number of steps to get there.

We can stop at a position if:
no other pieces stopped at that position, andother pieces already went through that position (transitional position with less number of steps).

Complexity:

Time: O(n!)
Space: O(1)
