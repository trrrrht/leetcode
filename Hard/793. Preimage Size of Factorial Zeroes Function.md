**Problem:**
Let `f(x)` be the number of zeroes at the end of `x!`. Recall that `x! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * x` and by convention, `0! = 1`.

- For example, `f(3) = 0` because `3! = 6` has no zeroes at the end, while `f(11) = 2` because `11! = 39916800` has two zeroes at the end.

Given an integer `k`, return the number of non-negative integers `x` have the property that `f(x) = k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: k = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! end with k = 0 zeroes.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no x such that x! ends in k = 5 zeroes.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: k = 3
Output: 5
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
        int sum[13]={1};
        for (int i=1; i<13; i++) sum[i]=sum[i-1]*5+1;
        for (int i=12; i>=0; i--) {
            if (K/sum[i]==5) return 0;
            K=K%sum[i];
        }
        return 5;
    }
```
Correctness:

Use g(x) represents f(x) - f(x - 1) to see the rule of ending zero.
