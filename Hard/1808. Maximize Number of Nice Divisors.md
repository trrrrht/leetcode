**Problem:**
You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are asked to construct a positive integer `n` that satisfies the following conditions:

- The number of prime factors of `n` (not necessarily distinct) is **at most** `primeFactors`.
- The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is **nice** if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.

Return *the number of nice divisors of* `n`. Since that number can be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number `n` is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals `n`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: primeFactors = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: primeFactors = 8
Output: 18
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= primeFactors <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int power(long long base, int pow){
        if(pow==0)return 1;
        return (pow&1?(base*power(base,pow-1))%1000000007:power((base*base)%1000000007,pow/2))%1000000007;
    }
    int maxNiceDivisors(int primeFactors) {
        long ans = 1;
        if(primeFactors%3==1&&primeFactors>1){
            ans  = 4;
            primeFactors -= 4;
        }
        else if(primeFactors%3==2){
            ans =2;
            primeFactors-=2;
        }
        return (power(3,primeFactors/3)*ans)%1000000007;
    }
```
Correctness:

The total number of good divisors will be the product of the amount of each type of prime factor. In order to maximize this product, each prime number's frequency must be exceed 3. After discussing, we could separate the situation into 3 aspects
