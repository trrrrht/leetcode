**Problem:**
There is a 2D `grid` of size `n x n` where each cell of this grid has a lamp that is initially **turned off**.

You are given a 2D array of lamp positions `lamps`, where `lamps[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that the lamp at `grid[rowi][coli]` is **turned on**. Even if the same lamp is listed more than once, it is turned on.

When a lamp is turned on, it **illuminates its cell** and **all other cells** in the same **row, column, or diagonal**.

You are also given another 2D array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [rowj, colj]`. For the `jth` query, determine whether `grid[rowj][colj]` is illuminated or not. After answering the `jth` query, **turn off** the lamp at `grid[rowj][colj]` and its **8 adjacent lamps** if they exist. A lamp is adjacent if its cell shares either a side or corner with `grid[rowj][colj]`.

Return *an array of integers* `ans`*,* *where* `ans[j]` *should be* `1` *if the cell in the* `jth` *query was illuminated, or* `0` *if the lamp was not.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,0]]
Output: [1,0]
Explanation: We have the initial grid with all lamps turned off. In the above picture we see the grid after turning on the lamp at grid[0][0] then turning on the lamp at grid[4][4].
The 0th query asks if the lamp at grid[1][1] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is illuminated, so set ans[0] = 1. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red square.

The 1st query asks if the lamp at grid[1][0] is illuminated or not (the blue square). It is not illuminated, so set ans[1] = 0. Then, we turn off all lamps in the red rectangle.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[4,4]], queries = [[1,1],[1,1]]
Output: [1,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, lamps = [[0,0],[0,4]], queries = [[0,4],[0,1],[1,4]]
Output: [1,1,0]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 109`
- `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
- `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
- `lamps[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= rowi, coli < n`
- `queries[j].length == 2`
- `0 <= rowj, colj < n`

                        d2[x+y]--;
                    }
                }
            }
            else
                res.push_back(0);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

We use lit to indicate which light is on and use other four arrays to indicate how many lights are on on one line. In this case, we could compress the space and running time we use..

Complexity:

Time: O($n$)
Space: O($n^2$)
