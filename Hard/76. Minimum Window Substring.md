**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return *the **minimum window substring** of* `s` *such that every character in* `t` *(**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring**, return the empty string* `""`*.*

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `m == s.length`
- `n == t.length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 105`
- `s` and `t` consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.

 

**Follow up:** Could you find an algorithm that runs in `O(m + n)` time?
**Other Solution:**
```
string minWindow(string s, string t) {
        unordered_map<char, int> m;
        for (auto c : t) m[c]++;
        size_t start = 0, end = 0, counter = t.size(), minStart = 0, minLen = INT_MAX;
        size_t size = s.size();
        while (end < size) {
            if (m[s[end]] > 0)
                counter--;
            m[s[end]]--;
            end++;
            while (counter == 0) {
                if (end - start < minLen) {
                    minStart = start;
                    minLen = end - start;
                }
                m[s[start]]++;
                if (m[s[start]] > 0)
                    counter++;
                start++;
            }
        }
        if (minLen != INT_MAX)
            return s.substr(minStart, minLen);
        return "";
    }
```
Correctness:

We should ignore the order of the chars in t. And we use counter to indicate whether the chars in substring include all the chars in t. Also, we use two pointers to find the begin and end of the substring. In this case, for each substring, we just have to update the part of the substring before it.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
