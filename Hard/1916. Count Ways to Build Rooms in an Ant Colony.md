**Problem:**
You are an ant tasked with adding `n` new rooms numbered `0` to `n-1` to your colony. You are given the expansion plan as a **0-indexed** integer array of length `n`, `prevRoom`, where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that you must build room `prevRoom[i]` before building room `i`, and these two rooms must be connected **directly**. Room `0` is already built, so `prevRoom[0] = -1`. The expansion plan is given such that once all the rooms are built, every room will be reachable from room `0`.

You can only build **one room** at a time, and you can travel freely between rooms you have **already built** only if they are **connected**. You can choose to build **any room** as long as its **previous room** is already built.

Return *the **number of different orders** you can build all the rooms in*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d1.JPG)

```
Input: prevRoom = [-1,0,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only one way to build the additional rooms: 0 → 1 → 2
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/19/d2.JPG)**

```
Input: prevRoom = [-1,0,0,1,2]
Output: 6
Explanation:
The 6 ways are:
0 → 1 → 3 → 2 → 4
0 → 2 → 4 → 1 → 3
0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
0 → 1 → 2 → 4 → 3
0 → 2 → 1 → 3 → 4
0 → 2 → 1 → 4 → 3
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == prevRoom.length`
- `2 <= n <= 105`
- `prevRoom[0] == -1`
- `0 <= prevRoom[i] < n` for all `1 <= i < n`
- Every room is reachable from room `0` once all the rooms are built.
**Other Solution:**
```
public:
    int waysToBuildRooms(vector<int>& prevRoom) {
        int n = prevRoom.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> g(n);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            g[prevRoom[i]].push_back(i);
        }
        
        vector<ll> fac(n + 1, 1), ifac(n + 1, 1);
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            fac[i] = fac[i - 1] * i % mod;
            ifac[i] = qpow(fac[i], mod - 2);
        }
        
        return dfs(g, fac, ifac, 0).first;
    }
private:
    using ll = long long;
    static constexpr int mod = 1e9 + 7;
    
    ll qpow(ll x, size_t n) {
        ll ans = 1;
        for (auto i = n; i; i /= 2) {
            if (i % 2) ans = ans * x % mod;
            x = x * x % mod;
        }
        return ans;
    }

    pair<ll, ll> dfs(const vector<vector<int>>& g, const vector<ll>& fac, const vector<ll>& ifac, int cur) {
        if(g[cur].size() == 0)
            return {1,1};
        ll ans = 1, l = 0;
        for(int nxt : g[cur]) {
            auto [tmp, r] = dfs(g, fac, ifac, nxt);
            ll comb =  (((fac[l+r] * ifac[l]) % mod) * ifac[r]) % mod;
            ans = (ans * tmp % mod) * comb % mod;
            l += r;
        }
        return {ans, l + 1};
    }
```
Correctness:

For each house, we could use dfs to search when should it be built and try all the possible combinations

Complexity:

Time: O(n!)
Space: O($n^2$)
