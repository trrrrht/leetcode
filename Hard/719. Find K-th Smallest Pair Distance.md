**Problem:**
Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest **distance** among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
nums = [1,3,1]
k = 1
Output: 0 
Explanation:
Here are all the pairs:
(1,3) -> 2
(1,1) -> 0
(3,1) -> 2
Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.
```



**Note:**

1. `2 <= len(nums) <= 10000`.
2. `0 <= nums[i] < 1000000`.
3. `1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int smallestDistancePair(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
        sort(nums.begin(), nums.end());
        int low = 0;
        int high = nums[nums.size() - 1] - nums[0];
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int count = 0;
            int left = 0;
            for (int right = 0; right < nums.size(); right++) {
                while (nums[right] - nums[left] > mid) {
                    left++;
                }
                count += right - left;
            }
            if (count >= k) {
                high = mid;
            }
            else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }
```
Correctness:

This idea is excellant. Since we want to find the k-th smallest distance between two values in the array, we can set the subduction of biggest and smallest values in the array as the high boundary. And since the distance is defined as the absolute of two values, the low boundary is 0.

In this case, we just have to use binary search to find the k-th smallest value between high and low boundary (set mid and find whether the k-th smallest distance in 0 to mid. If not, we should increase the searching range by increase low boundary. If yes, we should decrease high boundary to reduce the search range).

For each mid, we should calculate how many distances are smaller that it, so we can sort the original array and use two pointers(If we find the distance that is lager or equal to mid, we should move the first pointer, otherwise, we should move the second pointer).

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
