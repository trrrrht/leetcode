**Problem:**
There are `n` cars traveling at different speeds in the same direction along a one-lane road. You are given an array `cars` of length `n`, where `cars[i] = [positioni, speedi]` represents:

- `positioni` is the distance between the `ith` car and the beginning of the road in meters. It is guaranteed that `positioni < positioni+1`.
- `speedi` is the initial speed of the `ith` car in meters per second.

For simplicity, cars can be considered as points moving along the number line. Two cars collide when they occupy the same position. Once a car collides with another car, they unite and form a single car fleet. The cars in the formed fleet will have the same position and the same speed, which is the initial speed of the **slowest** car in the fleet.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the time, in seconds, at which the `ith` car collides with the next car, or `-1` if the car does not collide with the next car. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answers are accepted.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: cars = [[1,2],[2,1],[4,3],[7,2]]
Output: [1.00000,-1.00000,3.00000,-1.00000]
Explanation: After exactly one second, the first car will collide with the second car, and form a car fleet with speed 1 m/s. After exactly 3 seconds, the third car will collide with the fourth car, and form a car fleet with speed 2 m/s.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: cars = [[3,4],[5,4],[6,3],[9,1]]
Output: [2.00000,1.00000,1.50000,-1.00000]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= cars.length <= 105`
- `1 <= positioni, speedi <= 106`
- `positioni < positioni+1`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<double> getCollisionTimes(vector<vector<int>>& A) {
        int n = A.size();
        vector<int> stack;
        vector<double> res(n, -1);
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int p = A[i][0], s = A[i][1];
            while (!stack.empty()) {
                int j = stack.back(), p2 = A[j][0], s2 = A[j][1];
                if (s <= s2 || 1.0 * (p2 - p) / (s - s2) >= res[j] && res[j] > 0)
                    stack.pop_back();
                else
                    break;
            }
            if (!stack.empty())
                res[i] = 1.0 * (A[stack.back()][0] - p) / (s - A[stack.back()][1]);
            stack.push_back(i);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Iterate the last to the first car, the collision time is strict decreasing. If a catches b later than b catches c, then a won't catch b but b + c

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
