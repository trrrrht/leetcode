**Problem:**
The set `[1, 2, 3, ..., n]` contains a total of `n!` unique permutations.

By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for `n = 3`:

1. `"123"`
2. `"132"`
3. `"213"`
4. `"231"`
5. `"312"`
6. `"321"`

Given `n` and `k`, return the `kth` permutation sequence.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 9`
- `1 <= k <= n!`
**Other Solution:**
```
string getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        string res;
        string nums = "123456789";
        int f[10] = {1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, 40320, 362880};
        --k;
        for (int i = n; i >= 1; --i) {
            int j = k / f[i - 1];
            k %= f[i - 1];
            res.push_back(nums[j]);
            nums.erase(nums.begin() + j);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

The idea of this algorithm is that we select number from 1 to n in the correct order. And f is the number of the permutations. For each number, when it's in ith place, there're are fixed number of permutations, so we could calculate what the kth permutation is

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
