**Problem:**
Strings `s1` and `s2` are `k`**-similar** (for some non-negative integer `k`) if we can swap the positions of two letters in `s1` exactly `k` times so that the resulting string equals `s2`.

Given two anagrams `s1` and `s2`, return the smallest `k` for which `s1` and `s2` are `k`**-similar**.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "ba"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s1 = "abc", s2 = "bca"
Output: 2
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s1.length <= 20`
- `s2.length == s1.length`
- `s1` and `s2` contain only lowercase letters from the set `{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'}`.
- `s2` is an anagram of `s1`.
**Other Solution:**
```
unordered_map<string,unordered_map<int,int>>mp;
    int soln(string &s1, string &s2, int i, int j)
    {
        if(i==0)
        {
            return 0;
        }
        if(mp.count(s1)&& mp[s1].count(i))
        {
            return mp[s1][i];
        }
        if(s1[i-1]==s2[j-1])
        {
            return mp[s1][i]=soln(s1,s2,i-1, j-1);
        }
        int ans=INT_MAX;
        for(int idx=i;idx>=1;idx--)
        {
            if(s1[idx-1]==s2[j-1])
            {
                swap(s1[idx-1],s1[i-1]);
                ans=min(ans,1+soln(s1,s2,i-1,j-1));
                swap(s1[idx-1],s1[i-1]);
            }
        }
        return mp[s1][i]=ans;
    }
    
    int kSimilarity(string s1, string s2) {
        return soln(s1,s2,s1.size(),s2.size());
    }
```
Correctness:


In the optimal strategy, each swap should contribute to at least 1 match of characters. We also note the best we can achieve in a single swap is 2 matches, which is guaranteed to be optimal (although it might not be the only one). Therefore, if A[i]!=B[i], we should try our luck and look for a position j, such that A[j]==B[i] && A[i]==B[j], if one is found, then we achieve a optimal double match and proceed to match the remaining. Otherwise, we look for a position j, such that A[j]==B[i], and MAKE SURE IT IS NOT A MATCH ALREADY (i.e., A[j]!=B[j], otherwise you simply push the mismatch in position i to position j and don't make any real progress). There might be multiple positions j satisfying such condition, and we need to go over each one of them, as certain j might give rise to a double match later on, and therefore outperform others.
