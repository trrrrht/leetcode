**Problem:**
You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in the form of a parent array `parent` where `parent[i]` is the parent of `ith` node. The root of the tree is node `0`. Find the `kth` ancestor of a given node.

The `kth` ancestor of a tree node is the `kth` node in the path from that node to the root node.

Implement the `TreeAncestor` class:

- `TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent)` Initializes the object with the number of nodes in the tree and the parent array.
- `int getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` return the `kth` ancestor of the given node `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/08/28/1528_ex1.png)

```
Input
["TreeAncestor", "getKthAncestor", "getKthAncestor", "getKthAncestor"]
[[7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]], [3, 1], [5, 2], [6, 3]]
Output
[null, 1, 0, -1]

Explanation
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1); // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2); // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3); // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `parent.length == n`
- `parent[0] == -1`
- `0 <= parent[i] < n` for all `0 < i < n`
- `0 <= node < n`
- There will be at most `5 * 104` queries.
**Other Solution:**
```

class TreeAncestor {public:
    vector<vector<int> > P; 
    TreeAncestor(int n, vector<int>& parent) {
        P.resize(20, vector<int>(parent.size(), -1));
        for(int i = 0; i < parent.size(); i++){
            P[0][i] = parent[i];
        }
        for(int i = 1; i < 20; i++){
            for(int node = 0; node < parent.size(); node ++){
                int nodep = P[i-1][node];
                if(nodep != -1) P[i][node] = P[i-1][nodep];
            }
        }
    }
    
    int getKthAncestor(int node, int k) {
        for(int i = 0; i < 20; i++){
            if(k & (1 << i)){
                node = P[i][node];
                if(node == -1) return -1;
            }
        }

        return node;
    }
};
```
Correctness:

we have 1st parent for node.
use this, we can know 2nd parent, by searching [1st parent]'s [2^0 = 1st parent],
to know the 3rd parent, trace [2nd parent]'s [1st parent]
to know the 4th parent, trace [2nd parent]'s [2nd parent] -> we memory it as [2^2 = 4th parent]
to know the 5th parent, trace [4th parent]'s [1st parent].....

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(nlogn)
