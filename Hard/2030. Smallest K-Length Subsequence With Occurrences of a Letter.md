**Problem:**
You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.

Return *the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of* `s` *of length* `k` *that has the letter* `letter` *appear **at least*** `repetition` *times*. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` **at least** `repetition` times.

A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
Output: "eet"
Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
- "lee" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "let" (from "leet")
- "eet" (from "leet")
The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
```

**Example 2:**

![example-2](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/09/13/smallest-k-length-subsequence.png)

```
Input: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
Output: "ecde"
Explanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
Output: "bb"
Explanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.
**Other Solution:**
```
string smallestSubsequence(string s, int k, char letter, int rep) {
        int extra = count(begin(s), end(s), letter) - rep, remove = s.size() - k;
        string mono, res;
        for (auto ch : s) {
            while (!mono.empty() && mono.back() > ch && remove) {
                if (mono.back() == letter && extra == 0)
                    break;
                extra -= mono.back() == letter;
                --remove;
                mono.pop_back();
            }
            mono += ch;
        }
        for (int i = 0; res.size() < k; ++i) {
            if (mono[i] != letter && res.size() + max(0, rep) >= k)
                continue;
            res += mono[i];
            rep -= mono[i] == letter;
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


We build our non-decreasing stack:While the previous character is larger, we remove it.
We can remove up to n - k characters. And we just copy the remaining characters.If that larger character is letter, we remove it only if we have extra.Note that our "monostack" can have more chars that we need. So we pick k characters from monostack, from smaller to larger. We ensure that we also pick a rep number of letter, and we do it by only picking k - rep of other characters.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
