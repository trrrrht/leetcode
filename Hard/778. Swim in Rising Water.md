**Problem:**
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at that point `(i, j)`.

The rain starts to fall. At time `t`, the depth of the water everywhere is `t`. You can swim from a square to another 4-directionally adjacent square if and only if the elevation of both squares individually are at most `t`. You can swim infinite distances in zero time. Of course, you must stay within the boundaries of the grid during your swim.

Return *the least time until you can reach the bottom right square* `(n - 1, n - 1)` *if you start at the top left square* `(0, 0)`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/29/swim2-grid-1.jpg)

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
Output: 16
Explanation: The final route is shown.
We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] < n2`
- Each value `grid[i][j]` is **unique**.
**Other Solution:**
```
public:

    struct T {
        int t, x, y;
        T(int a, int b, int c) : t (a), x (b), y (c){}
        bool operator< (const T &d) const {return t > d.t;}
    };

    int swimInWater(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int N = grid.size (), res = 0;
        priority_queue<T> pq;
        pq.push(T(grid[0][0], 0, 0));
        vector<vector<int>> seen(N, vector<int>(N, 0));
        seen[0][0] = 1;
        static int dir[4][2] = {{0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, { -1, 0}};

        while (true) {
            auto p = pq.top ();
            pq.pop ();
            res = max(res, p.t);
            if (p.x == N - 1 && p.y == N - 1) return res;
            for (auto& d : dir) {
                int i = p.x + d[0], j = p.y + d[1];
                if (i >= 0 && i < N && j >= 0 && j < N && !seen[i][j]) {
                    seen[i][j] = 1;
                    pq.push (T(grid[i][j], i, j));
                }
            }
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

For each step, we should check the smallest cell we could go to and then append the neighbors of it.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
