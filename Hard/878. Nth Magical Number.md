**Problem:**
A positive integer is *magical* if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

Given the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, return the `nth` magical number. Since the answer may be very large, **return it modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 4
Output: 10
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 3, a = 6, b = 4
Output: 8
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 109`
- `2 <= a, b <= 4 * 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int nthMagicalNumber(int N, int A, int B) {
        int MOD = 1e9 + 7;
        int L = A / gcd(A, B) * B;

        long lo = 0;
        long hi = (long) N * min(A, B);
        while (lo < hi) {
            long mi = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (mi / A + mi / B - mi / L < N)
                lo = mi + 1;
            else
                hi = mi;
        }

        return (int) (lo % MOD);
    }

    int gcd(int x, int y) {
        if (x == 0) return y;
        return gcd(y % x, x);
    }
```
Correctness:

L is the least commom multiple of A and B. The number of magical number between 0 and x must be x / A + x / B - x / L, because we should add all the numbers divisible by A and all the numbers divisible by B. Furthermore, we should substract all the numbers divisible by both A and B because they are counted twice.

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(1)
