**Problem:**
You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The **GCD** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides **all** the numbers in the sequence evenly.

- For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

- For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,**2**,4,1,**5**,**10**]`.

Return *the **number** of **different** GCDs among all **non-empty** subsequences of* `nums`.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/17/image-1.png)

```
Input: nums = [6,10,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.
The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,15,40,5,6]
Output: 7
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 105`
**Other Solution:**
```
class Solution {
public:
    int countDifferentSubsequenceGCDs(vector<int>& a){
        int ans=0;
        int ma=INT_MIN;
        int n=a.size();
        int b[2000001]={0}; 
        
		for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            ma=max(ma, a[i]); 
            b[a[i]]=1;
        }
        
		for(int i=1;i<=ma;i++){
            int cgcd=0;  
			for(int j=i;j<=ma;j+=i){  
                if(b[j]==1){  
                    cgcd=__gcd(cgcd, j);
                }
               
			   if(cgcd==i){  
                    ans++; 
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
};

static bool     _foo = ios::sync_with_stdio(false);
static ostream* _bar = cin.tie(NULL);
```
Correctness:

Find the max number and loop all possible candidates wich can be gcd (from 1 to max number). Check all the multiples of them to get all gcd and count the number

Complexity:

Time: O($n^{1.5}$)
Space: O(n)
