**Problem:**
Given the array `houses` and an integer `k`. where `houses[i]` is the location of the ith house along a street, your task is to allocate `k` mailboxes in the street.

Return the **minimum** total distance between each house and its nearest mailbox.

The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], k = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3, 9 and 20.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |3-1| + |4-3| + |9-8| + |10-9| + |20-20| = 5 
```

**Example 2:**

**![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/05/07/sample_2_1816.png)**

```
Input: houses = [2,3,5,12,18], k = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes in position 3 and 14.
Minimum total distance from each houses to nearest mailboxes is |2-3| + |3-3| + |5-3| + |12-14| + |18-14| = 9.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: houses = [7,4,6,1], k = 1
Output: 8
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: houses = [3,6,14,10], k = 4
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == houses.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= houses[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= n`
- Array `houses` contain unique integers.
**Other Solution:**
```
int minDistance(vector<int>& A, int K) {
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        int n = A.size();
        vector<int> B(n + 1, 0), dp(n, 1e6);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            B[i + 1] = B[i] + A[i];
        for (int k = 1; k <= K; ++k)
            for (int j = n - 1; j > k - 2; --j)
                for (int i = k - 2; i < j; ++i) {
                    int m1 =  (i + j + 1) / 2, m2 = (i + j + 2) / 2;
                    int last = (B[j + 1] - B[m2]) - (B[m1 + 1] - B[i + 1]);
                    dp[j] = min(dp[j], (i >= 0 ? dp[i] : 0) + last);
                }
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
```
Correctness:

dp means the minimum distance of i + 1 first house.
