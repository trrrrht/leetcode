**Problem:**
There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to `n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are **visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are no **longer** sticks to the **left** of it.

- For example, if the sticks are arranged `[1,3,2,5,4]`, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.

Given `n` and `k`, return *the **number** of such arrangements*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 5, k = 5
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,2,3,4,5] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 20, k = 11
Output: 647427950
Explanation: There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= n`
**Other Solution:**
```
int dp[1001][1001];
    int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k, int mod = 1000000007) {
        if (n == k) return 1;
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        if (dp[n][k] == 0)
            dp[n][k]  = (1L * rearrangeSticks(n - 1, k - 1) + 1L * rearrangeSticks(n - 1, k) * (n - 1)) % mod;
        return dp[n][k];
    }
```
Correctness:

There are two situation when we want to arrange the n sticks to see k. First if it's the largest, then n-1 stick to see k-1. If it's not the largest, n-1 choices for the last elements, then n-1 stick to see k

Complexity:

Time: O(n!)
Space: O($n^2$)
