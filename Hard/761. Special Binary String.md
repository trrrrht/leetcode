**Problem:**
**Special binary strings** are binary strings with the following two properties:

- The number of `0`'s is equal to the number of `1`'s.
- Every prefix of the binary string has at least as many `1`'s as `0`'s.

You are given a **special binary** string `s`.

A move consists of choosing two consecutive, non-empty, special substrings of `s`, and swapping them. Two strings are consecutive if the last character of the first string is exactly one index before the first character of the second string.

Return *the lexicographically largest resulting string possible after applying the mentioned operations on the string*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "11011000"
Output: "11100100"
Explanation: The strings "10" [occuring at s[1]] and "1100" [at s[3]] are swapped.
This is the lexicographically largest string possible after some number of swaps.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "10"
Output: "10"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 50`
- `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
- `s` is a special binary string.
**Other Solution:**
```
string makeLargestSpecial(string s) {
        vector<string> res;
        for (int i = 0, prev = 0, counter = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if ((s[i] == '0' ? --counter : ++counter) == 0) {
                res.push_back("1" + makeLargestSpecial(s.substr(prev + 1, i - prev - 1)) + "0");
                prev = i + 1;
            }
        }
        sort(res.rbegin(), res.rend());
        return accumulate(res.begin(), res.end(), string(), [](const string& s1, const string& s2){return s1 + s2;});
    }
```
Correctness:


Split S into several special strings (as many as possible). Special string starts with 1 and ends with 0. Recursion on the middle part.Sort all special strings in lexicographically largest order. Join and output all strings.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
