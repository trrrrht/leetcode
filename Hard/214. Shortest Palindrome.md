**Problem:**
You are given a string `s`. You can convert `s` to a palindrome by adding characters in front of it.

Return *the shortest palindrome you can find by performing this transformation*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "aacecaaa"
Output: "aaacecaaa"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "abcd"
Output: "dcbabcd"
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.
**Other Solution:**
```
string shortestPalindrome(string s) {
        string rev_s = s;
        reverse(rev_s.begin(), rev_s.end());
        string l = s + "#" + rev_s;
        
        vector<int> p(l.size(), 0);
        for (int i = 1; i < l.size(); i++) {
            int j = p[i - 1];
            while (j > 0 && l[i] != l[j])
                j = p[j - 1];
            p[i] = (j += l[i] == l[j]);
        }
        
        return rev_s.substr(0, s.size() - p[l.size() - 1]) + s;
    }
```
Correctness:

After running KMP on that string as result, we get a p with values of a prefix function for each char. We only interested in the last value because it shows us the largest suffix of the reversed string that matches the prefix of the original string. So basically all we left to do is to add the first k char of the reversed string to the original string, where k is difference between original string size and the prefix function for the last char of a constructed string.
