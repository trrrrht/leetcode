**Problem:**
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarification:** The input/output format is the same as [how LeetCode serializes a binary tree](https://leetcode.com/faq/#binary-tree). You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/15/serdeser.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: [1]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: root = [1,2]
Output: [1,2]
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
class Codec {
public:

    string serialize(TreeNode* root) {
        ostringstream out;
        serialize(root, out);
        return out.str();
    }

    TreeNode* deserialize(string data) {
        istringstream in(data);
        return deserialize(in);
    }

private:

    void serialize(TreeNode* root, ostringstream& out) {
        if (root) {
            out << root->val << ' ';
            serialize(root->left, out);
            serialize(root->right, out);
        } else {
            out << "# ";
        }
    }

    TreeNode* deserialize(istringstream& in) {
        string val;
        in >> val;
        if (val == "#")
            return nullptr;
        TreeNode* root = new TreeNode(stoi(val));
        root->left = deserialize(in);
        root->right = deserialize(in);
        return root;
    }
};
```
Correctness:

Just simulate the process

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
