**Problem:**
Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array `fruits` where `fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti]` depicts `amounti` fruits at the position `positioni`. `fruits` is already **sorted** by `positioni` in **ascending order**, and each `positioni` is **unique**.

You are also given an integer `startPos` and an integer `k`. Initially, you are at the position `startPos`. From any position, you can either walk to the **left or right**. It takes **one step** to move **one unit** on the x-axis, and you can walk **at most** `k` steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.

Return *the **maximum total number** of fruits you can harvest*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/2.png)

```
Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/11/21/3.png)

```
Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= fruits.length <= 105`
- `fruits[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= startPos, positioni <= 2 * 105`
- `positioni-1 < positioni` for any `i > 0` (**0-indexed**)
- `1 <= amounti <= 104`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 105`
**Other Solution:**
```
int MX = 2e5 + 2;
class Solution {
public:
    int maxTotalFruits(vector<vector<int>>& fruits, int startPos, int k) {
        int i, l, r, ans = 0;
        startPos++;
        vector<int> prefix_sum(MX);
        for(auto &it: fruits) prefix_sum[it[0] + 1] = it[1];
        for(i = 1; i < MX; i++) prefix_sum[i] += prefix_sum[i - 1];
        
        for(r = startPos; r < MX && r <= startPos + k; r++){
            l = min(startPos, startPos - (k - 2 * (r - startPos)));
            l = max(1, l);
            ans = max(ans, prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l - 1]);
        }
        
        for(l = startPos; l > 0 && l >= startPos - k; l--){
            r = max(startPos, startPos + (k - 2 * (startPos - l)));
            r = min(MX - 1, r);
            ans = max(ans, prefix_sum[r] - prefix_sum[l - 1]);
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
Correctness:


We only need to find the range [leftmost position(l), righmost position(r)] that can be covered. If that can be calculated then total fruits in that range can be calculated using Prefix Sum.So the first step is to calculate the Prefix Sum for the max possible position. After that we need to run two loops.
First loop will be the case where we move to right first and then to left.
Second loop will be the case where we move to left first and then to right.Final answer is the maximum of fruits covered in all the possible ranges.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
