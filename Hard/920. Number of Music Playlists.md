**Problem:**
Your music player contains `n` different songs. You want to listen to `goal` songs (not necessarily different) during your trip. To avoid boredom, you will create a playlist so that:

- Every song is played **at least once**.
- A song can only be played again only if `k` other songs have been played.

Given `n`, `goal`, and `k`, return *the number of possible playlists that you can create*. Since the answer can be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], and [3, 2, 1].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 0
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 possible playlists: [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], and [1, 2, 2].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, goal = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 possible playlists: [1, 2, 1] and [2, 1, 2].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= k < n <= goal <= 100`
**Other Solution:**
```
int numMusicPlaylists(int N, int L, int K) {
        long dp[N + 1][L + 1], mod = 1e9 + 7;
        for (int i = K + 1; i <= N; ++i)
            for (int j = i; j <= L; ++j)
                if ((i == j) || (i == K + 1))
                    dp[i][j] = factorial(i);
                else
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] * i + dp[i][j - 1] * (i - K))  % mod;
        return (int) dp[N][L];
    }

    long factorial(int n) {
        return n ? factorial(n - 1) * n % (long)(1e9 + 7) : 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

f(n, l, k) represents when there are n songs, l goals, k pre-play, so f(n, l, k) = f(n - 1, l - 1, k) * n + f(n, l - 1, k) * (n - k). 

f(n - 1, l - 1, k) represents only n - 1 in the l - 1 first songs, so there are n possible last song. 

f(n, l - 1, k) represents already n in the l - 1 first songs, we can put any song at the end of the list but should be different from k last song, so we have n - k choices

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
