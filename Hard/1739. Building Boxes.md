**Problem:**
You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to `n` units. You are asked to place `n` boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:

- You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
- If box `x` is placed on top of the box `y`, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box `y` **must** either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.

Given an integer `n`, return *the **minimum** possible number of boxes touching the floor.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the three boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/4-boxes.png)

```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the four boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the left side.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/01/04/10-boxes.png)

```
Input: n = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above is for the placement of the ten boxes.
These boxes are placed in the corner of the room, where the corner is on the back side.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        
        uint32_t h = cbrt((long)6*n);
        uint32_t pyramid_box_num = h*(h+1)/2*(h+2)/3;
        if ( pyramid_box_num > n ){
            h--;
            pyramid_box_num = h*(h+1)/2*(h+2)/3; 
        }
        
        int pyramid_base_num = (h)*(h+1)/2;
        
        n -= pyramid_box_num;
        
        int z = sqrt(2*n);
        int max_box_added = z*(z+1)/2;
        if ( max_box_added < n)
            z++;
        
        return pyramid_base_num+z;
    }
```
