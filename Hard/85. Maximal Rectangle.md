**Problem:**
Given a `rows x cols` binary `matrix` filled with `0`'s and `1`'s, find the largest rectangle containing only `1`'s and return *its area*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/14/maximal.jpg)

```
Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `rows == matrix.length`
- `cols == matrix[i].length`
- `0 <= row, cols <= 200`
- `matrix[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.
**My Solution:**
```
int findmax(vector<int> heights) {
        int maxarea = 0;
        vector<int> stack;
        int top = 0;
        heights.emplace_back(0);
        int size = heights.size();
        int i = 0;
        while (i < size) {
            
            if (stack.size() == 0 || heights[i] >= heights[stack[top - 1]]) {
                stack.emplace_back(i++);
                top++;    
            }
            else {
                if (stack.size() == 1) {
                    maxarea = max(maxarea, heights[stack[top - 1]] * i);
                }
                else {
                    maxarea = max(maxarea, heights[stack[top - 1]] * (i - stack[top - 2] - 1));
                }
                stack.pop_back();
                top--;
            }
            
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
    
    int maximalRectangle(vector<vector<char>>& matrix) {
        int maxarea = 0;
        if (matrix.size() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        vector<int> heights(matrix[0].size());
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[i].size(); j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == '1') {
                    heights[j] += 1;
                }
                else if (matrix[i][j] == '0') {
                    heights[j] = 0;
                }
            }
            maxarea = max(maxarea, findmax(heights));
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
```
Correctness:

After carefully checking this problem, I find that it's almost the same as problem 84 Largest Rectangle in Histogram because each row of the matrix can be seen as a array and the heights of that cell is the continuous "1" above it. 

In that case, we can use the algorithm in problem 84 for each row in the matrix to solve the problem.

Actually, we can just change the numbers in the matrix to reduce the space we use, but the input matrix's elements are chars, which means if the number is big, it will overflow.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
