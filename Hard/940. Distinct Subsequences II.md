**Problem:**
Given a string s, return *the number of **distinct non-empty subsequences** of* `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "abc"
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "c", "ab", "ac", "bc", and "abc".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6 distinct subsequences are "a", "b", "ab", "aa", "ba", and "aba".
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "aaa"
Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 distinct subsequences are "a", "aa" and "aaa".
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 2000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```

int distinctSubseqII(string S) {
        long endsWith[26] = {}, mod = 1e9 + 7;
        for (char c : S)
            endsWith[c - 'a'] = accumulate(begin(endsWith), end(endsWith), 1L) % mod;
        return accumulate(begin(endsWith), end(endsWith), 0L) % mod;
    }
```
Correctness:


Init an array endswith[26]endswith[i] to count how many sub sequence that ends with ith character.Now we have N = sum(endswith) different sub sequence,
add a new character c to each of them,
then we have N different sub sequence that ends with c.With this idea, we loop on the whole string S,
and we update end[c] = sum(end) + 1 for each character.We need to plus one here, because "c" itself is also a sub sequence.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
