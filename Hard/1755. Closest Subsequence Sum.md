**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return *the **minimum** possible value of* `abs(sum - goal)`.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.
The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
Output: 7
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
- `-107 <= nums[i] <= 107`
- `-109 <= goal <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int minAbsDifference(vector<int>& ns, int goal) {
        int res = abs(goal), pos = 0, neg = 0;
        for (auto n : ns)
            pos += max(0, n), neg += min(0, n);
        if (goal < neg || goal > pos)
            return min(abs(neg - goal), abs(goal - pos));
        set<int> h1{0}, h2{0};
        for (auto i = 0; i < ns.size() / 2; ++i)
            for (auto n : vector<int>(begin(h1), end(h1)))
                if (h1.insert(n + ns[i]).second)
                    res = min(res, abs(goal - n - ns[i]));
        for (auto i = ns.size() / 2; i < ns.size(); ++i)
            for (auto n : vector<int>(begin(h2), end(h2)))
                if (h2.insert(n + ns[i]).second) {
                    auto it = h1.lower_bound(goal - n - ns[i]);
                    if (it != end(h1))
                        res = min(res, abs(goal - n - ns[i] - *it));
                    if (it != begin(h1))
                        res = min(res, abs(goal - n - ns[i] - *prev(it)));
                    if (res == 0)
                        return res;
                }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Divide the array into two parts called h1 and h2. And we generate all possible sums for the first half part, then for the second too. For each sum from the second half, use binary search to find a complement sum in the first half using two sum closest

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2logn$)
Space: O(n)
