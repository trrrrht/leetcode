**Problem:**
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return *the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: heights = [2,4]
Output: 4
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= heights.length <= 105`
- `0 <= heights[i] <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
int largestRectangleArea(vector<int>& heights) {
        vector<int> stack;
        heights.emplace_back(0);
        int maxarea = 0;
        int top = 0;
        int i = 0;
        int size = heights.size();
        while (i < size) {
            if (stack.size() == 0 || heights[stack[top - 1]] <= heights[i]) {
                stack.emplace_back(i++);
                top++;
            }
            else {
                if (stack.size() == 1) {
                    maxarea = max(maxarea, heights[stack[top - 1]] * i);
                }
                else {
                    maxarea = max(maxarea, heights[stack[top - 1]] * (i - stack[top - 2] - 1));
                }
                stack.pop_back();
                top--;
            }
        }
        return maxarea;
    }
```
Correctness:

On the first thought, if we want to find the largest rectangles for each bar it self in this array, we should set this bar as the mid point and scan the bar on its left and right to find all the bars that are bigger than it. In that case, we can calculate the largest rectangle's area for the specific height. 

To ensure the width of the rectangle of bars increase, we should find monotonicly increasing subarray in this array. In this subarray, we know for sure each element can get larger and larger width by adding new bigger element. If we meet a smaller element than the last element in the subarray, we know at least for the last element, we have find the furthest right boundary to keep its height and form a rectangle.

And we also know in the subarray, the left boundary for the last element is settled because the subarray is a monotonicly increasing array. In that case, for the last element, we have found the biggest rectangle of its height. It's the same with the other element in the subarray. 

However, we may find a situation that some elements may be smaller than the element we meet now. Under such circumstance, we know for those elements, we can still increase the width of their rectangles, so we can keep form a monotonicly increasing subarray to increase the width for those elements.

As discussed above, we know we can find the largest rectangle for each element in the array in a reverse order (first-in-last-out), so we can use stack to save the subarray.

Pay attention to the situation that if we only have one element left in it, it must be the smallest element in the array, so the width of its rectangle is the size of the array.

And also we can reduce some conditions by adding a zero to the end of the array (this might be useful in many problems).
