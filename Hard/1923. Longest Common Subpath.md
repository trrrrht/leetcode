**Problem:**
There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. In this country, there is a road connecting **every pair** of cities.

There are `m` friends numbered from `0` to `m - 1` who are traveling through the country. Each one of them will take a path consisting of some cities. Each path is represented by an integer array that contains the visited cities in order. The path may contain a city **more than once**, but the same city will not be listed consecutively.

Given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `paths` where `paths[i]` is an integer array representing the path of the `ith` friend, return *the length of the **longest common subpath** that is shared by **every** friend's path, or* `0` *if there is no common subpath at all*.

A **subpath** of a path is a contiguous sequence of cities within that path.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],
                       [2,3,4],
                       [4,0,1,2,3]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common subpath is [2,3].
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[0],[1],[2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no common subpath shared by the three paths.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 5, paths = [[0,1,2,3,4],
                       [4,3,2,1,0]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The possible longest common subpaths are [0], [1], [2], [3], and [4]. All have a length of 1.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `m == paths.length`
- `2 <= m <= 105`
- `sum(paths[i].length) <= 105`
- `0 <= paths[i][j] < n`
- The same city is not listed multiple times consecutively in `paths[i]`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestCommonSubpath(int n, vector<vector<int>>& ps) {
        int l = 0, r = min_element(begin(ps), end(ps), [](const auto& a, const auto &b){ return a.size() < b.size(); })->size();
        long long base = 100001, mod = 100000000019;
        while (l < r) {
            int m = (l + r + 1) / 2;
            unordered_set<long long> hs;
            for (int i = 0; i < ps.size() && (i == 0 || !hs.empty()); ++i) {
                long long hash = 0, d = 1;
                unordered_set<long long> hs1;
                for (int j = 0; j < ps[i].size(); ++j) {
                    hash = (hash * base + ps[i][j]) % mod;
                    if (j >= m)
                        hash = (mod + hash - d * ps[i][j - m] % mod) % mod;
                    else
                        d = d * base % mod;    
                    if (j >= m - 1 && (i == 0 || hs.count(hash)))
                        hs1.insert(hash);
                }
                swap(hs, hs1);
            }
            if (hs.empty())
                r = m - 1;
            else
                l = m;            
        }
        return l;
    }
```
Correctness:

The idea is that, if we can find a subpath with length k, we can find a subpath with any length less than k. So, we can use a binary search to search for the maximum subpath length. To do that in O(n) for each string, we use a rolling hash approach. Collisions are possible, therefore we need to check the actual paths. In the solution below, we just pick hashing parameters to avoid collisions. 

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$logn)
Space: O(n)
