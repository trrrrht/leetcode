**Problem:**
Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return *the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.*

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= nums.length <= 104`
- `-109 <= nums[i] <= 109`

 

**Follow up:** Could you implement the `O(n)` solution?
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        unordered_set<int> uset;
        int length = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            uset.insert(nums[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            if (uset.find(nums[i] - 1) == uset.end()) {
                int tmp = nums[i] + 1;
                while (uset.find(tmp) != uset.end()) {
                    tmp++;
                }
                length = max(length, tmp - nums[i]);
            }
        }
        return length;
    }
```

Correctness:

As we know, this array can form several intervals without overlap, so if we can find the biggest and smallest numbers in each interval, we can know the max length.

To find each interval, we can store these numbers in a set and scan the original array to see whether the number we check now minus 1 are in the set. If not, it's the smallest number of one interval. After finding the smallest number in a interval, we can use a algorithm like dfs to find the biggest number in this interval. After that, we know the length of each interval.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
