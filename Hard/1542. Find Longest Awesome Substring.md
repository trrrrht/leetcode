**Problem:**
You are given a string `s`. An **awesome** substring is a non-empty substring of `s` such that we can make any number of swaps in order to make it a palindrome.

Return *the length of the maximum length **awesome substring** of* `s`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "3242415"
Output: 5
Explanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142" with some swaps.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "12345678"
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "213123"
Output: 6
Explanation: "213123" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "231132" with some swaps.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s` consists only of digits.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestAwesome(string s) {
        int res = 0, cur = 0, n = s.size();
        vector<int> seen(1024, n);
        seen[0] = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            cur ^= 1 << (s[i] - '0');
            for (int a = 0; a < 10; ++a)
                res = max(res, i - seen[cur ^ (1 << a)]);
            res = max(res, i - seen[cur]);
            seen[cur] = min(seen[cur], i);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


We have 10 + 1 types of palindromes.Use any number as the middle character, or don't have a middle character.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
