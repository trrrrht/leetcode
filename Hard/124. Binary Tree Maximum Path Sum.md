**Problem:**
A **path** in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence **at most once**. Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.

The **path sum** of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the maximum **path sum** of any **non-empty** path*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/13/exx2.jpg)

```
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 3 * 104]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
**Other Solution:**
```
int max_sum=INT_MIN;
    int max_gain(TreeNode* root)
    {
        if(!root)return 0;
        int l=max(max_gain(root->left),0);
        int r=max(max_gain(root->right),0);
        int new_price=root->val+l+r;
        max_sum=max(max_sum,new_price);
        return root->val+max(l,r);
    }
    int maxPathSum(TreeNode* root) {
        max_gain(root);
        return max_sum;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each node, check the subtree of it to get the maimum num

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
