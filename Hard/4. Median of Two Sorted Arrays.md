**Problem:**

Given two sorted arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of size `m` and `n` respectively, return **the median** of the two sorted arrays.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3] and median is 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4]
Output: 2.50000
Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums1 = [0,0], nums2 = [0,0]
Output: 0.00000
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: nums1 = [], nums2 = [1]
Output: 1.00000
```

**Example 5:**

```
Input: nums1 = [2], nums2 = []
Output: 2.00000
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `nums1.length == m`
- `nums2.length == n`
- `0 <= m <= 1000`
- `0 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= m + n <= 2000`
- `-106 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 106`

 

**Follow up:** The overall run time complexity should be `O(log (m+n))`.



**My Solution:**
Only can merge these two array and find the median number, which does not satisfy the requirement. 



**Other Solution:**
```
double findMedianSortedArrays(vector<int>& nums1, vector<int>& nums2) {
        int size1 = nums1.size();
        int size2 = nums2.size();
        if (size1 > size2) {
            nums1.swap(nums2);
            int tmp = size1;
            size1 = size2;
            size2 = tmp;
        }
        if (size1 == 0) {
            if (size2 % 2 == 0) {
                return (nums2[size2 / 2] + nums2[size2 / 2 - 1]) / 2.0;
            } 
            else {
                return nums2[size2 / 2];
            }
        }
        int median = (size1 + size2 + 1) / 2;
        int high = size1;
        int low = 0;
        double result = 0;
        while(low <= high) {
            int a = low + (high - low) / 2;
            int b = median - a;
            if (a > 0 && nums1[a - 1] > nums2[b]) {
                high = a - 1;
            }
            else if (a < size1 && nums1[a] < nums2[b - 1]) {
                low = a + 1;
            }
            else {
                int leftend = (a == 0) ? nums2[b - 1] : (b == 0) ? nums1[a - 1] : max(nums1[a - 1], nums2[b - 1]);
                int rightstart = (a == size1) ? nums2[b] : (b == size2) ? nums1[a] : min(nums1[a], nums2[b]);
                if ((size1 + size2) % 2 == 0) {
                    result = (leftend + rightstart) / 2.0;
                }
                else {
                    result = leftend;
                }
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
```
Correctness:

When we see the requirement of the running time, we can assume we should use a algorithm like binary search (or others that can split the question to two part in each step).

And according to the defination of median, we know the last number of the first $\frac{m + n + 1}{2}$ (add 1 to round up) numbers must be the median (m + n is odd) or part of the median (m + n is even).

The challenge is how to decide how many numbers A and B array can contribute to the $\frac{m + n + 1}{2}$ numbers, separately. For example, if A has 5 numbers and B has 6 numbers, the median is the 6th number in the merged array of A and B. A(B) can contribute 1(5), 2(4)...... numbers to it.

If we focus on A, we know it can at least contribute 0 number to it (numbers in B are all smaller than A) or at most 5 to it (numbers in A are all smaller than B). To search the number between [0, 5], we can use binary search.

Another challenge is how to perform binary search in this question. As we know, the median must be the biggest number in the fitst $\frac{m + n + 1}{2}$ numbers, so for the last selected number in A and B, we should compare them and find the bigger one. However, the bigger one might not be the median because if the last selected number in A is bigger than the number behind the last selected number in B, when the two arrays are merged, the number in A must be behind it, which means median is the number behind the last selected number in B.

In that case, we assume the index of last selected number in A as i and that of the one in B as j. We should compare A[i], A[i + 1], B[j], B[j + 1]. There are some different situations. If B[j] > A[i + 1], it means A should contribute more numbers than now. It's the same with B, when A[i] > B[j + 1]. when the four numbers satisfy either B[j] < A[i] < B[j + 1], or A[i] < B[j] < A[i + 1], this binary search can be finished.

As discussed before, we can konw if we focus on the numbers that A contribute, the low boundary binary search should increase as $low + \frac{high - low}{2} + 1$ (to avoid the overflow of addition) when B[j] > A[i + 1], and the high boundary should decrease as $low + \frac{high - low}{2} - 1$

Also there're some other trivial problems, like out of index, which should be paid attention to.
