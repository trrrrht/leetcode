**Problem:**
You are given an integer `n` representing the length of an unknown array that you are trying to recover. You are also given an array `sums` containing the values of all `2n` **subset sums** of the unknown array (in no particular order).

Return *the array* `ans` *of length* `n` *representing the unknown array. If **multiple** answers exist, return **any** of them*.

An array `sub` is a **subset** of an array `arr` if `sub` can be obtained from `arr` by deleting some (possibly zero or all) elements of `arr`. The sum of the elements in `sub` is one possible **subset sum** of `arr`. The sum of an empty array is considered to be `0`.

**Note:** Test cases are generated such that there will **always** be at least one correct answer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 3, sums = [-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,-3]
Explanation: [1,2,-3] is able to achieve the given subset sums:
- []: sum is 0
- [1]: sum is 1
- [2]: sum is 2
- [1,2]: sum is 3
- [-3]: sum is -3
- [1,-3]: sum is -2
- [2,-3]: sum is -1
- [1,2,-3]: sum is 0
Note that any permutation of [1,2,-3] and also any permutation of [-1,-2,3] will also be accepted.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 2, sums = [0,0,0,0]
Output: [0,0]
Explanation: The only correct answer is [0,0].
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 4, sums = [0,0,5,5,4,-1,4,9,9,-1,4,3,4,8,3,8]
Output: [0,-1,4,5]
Explanation: [0,-1,4,5] is able to achieve the given subset sums.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 15`
- `sums.length == 2n`
- `-104 <= sums[i] <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> recoverArray(int n, vector<int>& s) {
        vector<int> res;
        sort(begin(s), end(s));
        while (s.size() > 1) {
            vector<int> l, r;
            int num = s[1] - s[0], l_zero = false;
            for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < s.size(); ++i)
                if (s[i] != INT_MIN) {
                    l_zero |= s[i] == 0;
                    l.push_back(s[i]);
                    r.push_back(s[i] + num);
                    for (j = max(j + 1, i + 1); s[j] != s[i] + num; ++j);
                    s[j] = INT_MIN;                    
                }
            res.push_back(num * (l_zero ? 1 : -1));
            swap(s, l_zero ? l : r);
        }
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:

Recursive Nature
    For n, we have 2^n subset sums&nbsp;[s1, s2, ... s(2^n)]. If we include another number&nbsp;x&nbsp;into the set, the array of subset sums doubles:[s1, s2, ... s(2^n)]&nbsp;+&nbsp;[s1 + x, s2 + x, ... s(2^n) + x]If we somehow can identify&nbsp;x, then we can split the array in half, and continue recursively on the first half (without&nbsp;x) - till we identify all numbers from the set.

Disambiguation 1
    This is the trickiest part. You can figure it out by building subset sums by hand with&nbsp;n == 3, trying all positive numbers, all negative, or a mix. You will find out that one of the numbers must be equal to the difference between the second smallest and the smallest sums. For this example&nbsp;[-3,-2,-1,0,0,1,2,3], one of the numbers is&nbsp;-2 - 3 == 1.But here comes the tricky part. It can be&nbsp;1, or it can be&nbsp;-1. At any rate, having a value is a good start, and we can disambiguate the sign later.

Split
    Here we split our subset sum array into two:&nbsp;[s1, s2, ... s(2^n)]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[s1 + x, s2 + x, ... s(2^n) + x]. The smallest sum (s1) belongs to the left array&nbsp;l. The second smallest must be&nbsp;s1 + x, as we figured out in the previous section, so we put it into the right array&nbsp;r.We continue picking numbers from the array, placing&nbsp;si&nbsp;into&nbsp;land&nbsp;si + x&nbsp;into&nbsp;r. Note that when we place&nbsp;si + x, we need to exclude it from the sums array so we won&apos;t process it again. Here is the demonstration for&nbsp;[-355,0,10,44,365,399,409,764]&nbsp;(which is already sorted):![26a31a66c65478340339e8ff69d205ee.png](en-resource://database/4927:0)
So, we got&nbsp;[-355, 10, 44, 409]&nbsp;and&nbsp;[0, 365, 399, 764].

Disambiguation 2
    Now we need to figure out the sign of&nbsp;x. We can do it by checking which of the arrays has zero after the split. Note that zero indicates an empty set, and we always use the array with the zero for the recursive operation.If the left array has zero, then the split was&nbsp;si&nbsp;and&nbsp;si + x; the sign is positive and we use the left array for the recursion. If the right array has zero, then the split actually was&nbsp;si - x&nbsp;and&nbsp;si; the sign is negative and we use the right array for the recursion.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^3$)
Space: O(n)
