**Problem:**
Design a stack-like data structure to push elements to the stack and pop the most frequent element from the stack.

Implement the `FreqStack` class:

- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.

- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the top of the stack.

- ```
  int pop()
  ```

   

  removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack.

  - If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the stack's top is removed and returned.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input
["FreqStack", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "push", "pop", "pop", "pop", "pop"]
[[], [5], [7], [5], [7], [4], [5], [], [], [], []]
Output
[null, null, null, null, null, null, null, 5, 7, 5, 4]

Explanation
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 7, as 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4].
freqStack.pop();   // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 is the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7].
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= val <= 109`
- At most `2 * 104` calls will be made to `push` and `pop`.
- It is guaranteed that there will be at least one element in the stack before calling `pop`.
**Other Solution:**
```
unordered_map<int, int> freq;
unordered_map<int, stack<int>> m;
int maxfreq = 0;

FreqStack() {

}

void push(int val) {
    maxfreq = max(maxfreq, ++freq[val]);
    m[freq[val]].push(val);
}

int pop() {
    int x = m[maxfreq].top();
    m[maxfreq].pop();
    if (!m[freq[x]--].size()) maxfreq--;
    return x;
}
```
Correctness:

The elegant idea is we use <frequency, stack>, so the mexfrequency will be continuous. For example. If we get push 5, 5, 5, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 3, 3, 1 and then pop them all. The stack will be {5: <5>, 4: <5>, 3: <5, 4, 3>, 2: <5, 4, 3>, 1: <5, 4, 3, 1>}. In this case, each time we pop one element, if we find the stack of maxfrequency is empty, we just have to substract maxfrequency by 1 to find the next max frequency

Complexity:

Time: O(1)
Space: O(n)
