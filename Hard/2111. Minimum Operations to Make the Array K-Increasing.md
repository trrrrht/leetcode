**Problem:**
You are given a **0-indexed** array `arr` consisting of `n` positive integers, and a positive integer `k`.

The array `arr` is called **K-increasing** if `arr[i-k] <= arr[i]` holds for every index `i`, where `k <= i <= n-1`.

- For example,

   

  ```
  arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2]
  ```

   

  is K-increasing for

   

  ```
  k = 2
  ```

   

  because:

  - `arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)`
  - `arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)`
  - `arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)`
  - `arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)`

- However, the same `arr` is not K-increasing for `k = 1` (because `arr[0] > arr[1]`) or `k = 3` (because `arr[0] > arr[3]`).

In one **operation**, you can choose an index `i` and **change** `arr[i]` into **any** positive integer.

Return *the **minimum number of operations** required to make the array K-increasing for the given* `k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= arr.length <= 105`
- `1 <= arr[i], k <= arr.length`
**Other Solution:**
```
int kIncreasing(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.size();
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            vector<int> newArr;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k)
                newArr.push_back(arr[j]);
            ans += newArr.size() - longestNonDecreasingSubsequence(newArr);
        }
        return ans;
    }
    int longestNonDecreasingSubsequence(const vector<int>& arr) {
        vector<int> sub;
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.size(); ++i) {
            int x = arr[i];
            if (sub.empty() || sub[sub.size() - 1] <= x) {
                sub.push_back(x);
            } else {
                int idx = upper_bound(sub.begin(), sub.end(), x) - sub.begin();
                sub[idx] = x;
            }
        }
        return sub.size();
    }
```
Correctness:


Firstly, we count Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence in that array.

Then the result is len(arr) - longestNonDecreasing(arr), because we only need to change elements not in the Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence.

For example: newArr = [18, 8, 8, 3, 9], the longest non-decreasing subsequence is [-, 8, 8, -, 9] and we just need to change the array into [8, 8, 8, 9, 9] by changing 18 -> 8, 3 -> 9.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
