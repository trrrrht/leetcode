**Problem:**
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return *the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`*.

A string's **subsequence** is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the remaining characters' relative positions. (i.e., `"ACE"` is a subsequence of `"ABCDE"` while `"AEC"` is not).

It is guaranteed the answer fits on a 32-bit signed integer.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from S.
rabbbit
rabbbit
rabbbit
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation:
As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from S.
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
babgbag
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 1000`
- `s` and `t` consist of English letters.
**My Solution:**
```
int numDistinct(string s, string t) {
        int n1 = s.size();
        int n2 = t.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n1 + 1, vector<int> (n2 + 1, 0));
    
        
        for(int i = 0; i < n1; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j < n2; j++) {
                if(j == 0) dp[i][j] = 1;
                
                if(s[i] == t[j]) 
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j + 1]) % 1000000007;
                else
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = dp[i][j + 1];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n1][n2];
    }
```
Correctness:

dp[i][j] represents the number of s[:i] could form t[:j]

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
