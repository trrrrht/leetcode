**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums`.

You should move each element of `nums` into one of the two arrays `A` and `B` such that `A` and `B` are non-empty, and `average(A) == average(B)`.

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve that and `false` otherwise.

**Note** that for an array `arr`, `average(arr)` is the sum of all the elements of `arr` over the length of `arr`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: true
Explanation: We can split the array into [1,4,5,8] and [2,3,6,7], and both of them have an average of 4.5.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: false
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 30`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 104`
**Other Solution:**
```
bool splitArraySameAverage(vector<int>& nums) {
        if(nums.size()<=1) {
            return false;
        }
        int n = nums.size();
        int Sum = 0;
        for(auto x: nums) Sum += x;
        
        int dp[Sum+1];
        memset(dp, 0, sizeof dp);
        dp[nums[0]] = 2;
        for(int i=1; i<n; i++) {
            for(int s=Sum-nums[i]; s>=0; s--) {
                if(dp[s])
                    dp[s+nums[i]] |= (dp[s]<<1);
            }
            dp[nums[i]] |= 2;
        }
        for(int len=1; len<n; len++) {
            if( (Sum*len)%n == 0 && ((1<<len) & dp[Sum*len/n])) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
```
Correctness:

Let the total array be A and the two subarray would be B and C. Ther will be avg(A) = avg(B) = avg(C), so sum(A) * len(B) / len(A) = sum(B). 

In this case, we just have to find the sub-array B, so we use dp[len][s] to represent whether there's a len subarray with s sum. For each value in array, we should check whether they could in the dp to form it, so the basic condition is that for each element in array, check from sum(A) - A[i] to 0. And for each this pair, we should check the length to see if there's the subarray. After forming the basic equation, we could use bitmask to reduce the space we use.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
