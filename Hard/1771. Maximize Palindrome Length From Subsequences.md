**Problem:**
You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:

- Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.
- Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.
- Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.

Return *the **length** of the longest **palindrome** that can be constructed in the described manner.* If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.

A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
Output: 5
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
Output: 3
Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.
**Other Solution:**
```
int longestPalindrome(string w1, string w2) {
        int sz = w1.size() + w2.size(), sz1 = w1.size(), res = 0;
        auto s = w1 + w2;
        vector<vector<int>> dp(sz + 1, vector<int>(sz + 1));
        for (int len = 1; len <= s.size(); ++len) 
            for (auto i = 0; i + len <= s.size(); ++i) 
                if (s[i] == s[i + len - 1]) {
                    dp[i][i + len] = dp[i + 1][i + len - 1] + (len == 1 ? 1 : 2);
                    if (i < sz1 && i + len > sz1)
                        res = max(res, dp[i][i + len]);
                }
                else
                    dp[i][i + len] = max(dp[i][i + len - 1],  dp[i + 1][i + len]);
        return res;
    }
```
Correctness:


The trick is to how to enforce the rule that characters should come from the both strings.So, we run the base algorithm on the concatenated string. At this point, our tabulation dp stores all interim solutions.Then, we reuse the tabulation dp and only consider i and j where w1[i] == w2[j].As additional optimization, for each i, we move j right-to-left, and break after we find w1[i] == w2[j]. In other word, we only consider the "widest" matching pairs.Update: you can collect first/last indexes of each 26 letters from both strings, and do the matching pair check in O(1). See the optimized solution below!Let's look on how our tabulation looks like for "baacaab", "dcddc":

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O($n^2$)
