**Problem:**
You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

- The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
- The height of the first building **must** be `0`.
- The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [idi, maxHeighti]` indicates that building `idi` must have a height **less than or equal to** `maxHeighti`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

Return *the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building*.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex1-1.png)

```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.
```

**Example 2:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex2.png)

```
Input: n = 6, restrictions = []
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.
```

**Example 3:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex3.png)

```
Input: n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.
We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= n <= 109`
- `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 105)`
- `2 <= idi <= n`
- `idi` is **unique**.
- `0 <= maxHeighti <= 109`
**Other Solution:**
```
int pass(vector<vector<int>>& r) {
        int res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < r.size() - 1; ++i) {
            auto h1 = r[i][1], h2 = r[i + 1][1];
            auto h = h1 + abs(r[i + 1][0] - r[i][0]);
            if (h > h2)
                h = h2 + (h - h2) / 2;
            res = max(res, h);
            r[i + 1][1] = min(h, h2);
        }
        return res;
    }
    int maxBuilding(int n, vector<vector<int>>& r) {
        r.insert(r.end(), {{1, 0}, {n, n - 1}});
        sort(begin(r), end(r));
        pass(r);
        reverse(begin(r), end(r));
        return pass(r);
    }
```
Correctness:

After sorting the restrictions, we could compute the max possible height between two restrictions. We assign the number of steps to h1. If h is higher than h2, we reduce it so it can descend to h2. If h is smaller than h2, we set h2 to h

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(1)
