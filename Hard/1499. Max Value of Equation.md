**Problem:**
You are given an array `points` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` such that `xi < xj` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Return *the maximum value of the equation* `yi + yj + |xi - xj|` where `|xi - xj| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`.

It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint `|xi - xj| <= k`.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: The first two points satisfy the condition |xi - xj| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.
No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= points.length <= 105`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `-108 <= xi, yi <= 108`
- `0 <= k <= 2 * 108`
- `xi < xj` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`
- `xi` form a strictly increasing sequence.
**Other Solution:**
```
int findMaxValueOfEquation(vector<vector<int>>& p, int k) {
		int n = p.size();
		deque<int> d;
		int ans = INT_MIN;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			while (d.size() and p[i][0] - p[d.front()][0] > k)  
				d.pop_front();
			if (d.size())
				ans = max(ans, p[i][0] + p[i][1] - (p[d.front()][0] - p[d.front()][1]));		
			while (d.size() and p[i][0] - p[i][1] <= p[d.back()][0] - p[d.back()][1]) 
				d.pop_back();
			d.push_back(i);
		}
		return ans;
	}
```
Correctness:

The equation $y_i + y_j + |x_i - x_j|$ is actually $y_i - x_i + x_j + y_j$. First, we should satisfy the requirement that $|x_i - x_j|$ <= k. By doing so, we could maintain a queue to store the indices because we should check whether the distance between the furthest x and the current x is larger than k. Except for that, we want for each i, $y_i - x_i$ could be max (but not necessarily used due to the distance), so for each i, we should check the value in the queue and pop them if they are smaller than the current one (if smaller, they could not form a bigger result). And for each i, we should also check whether it could form a bigger result with the front of the queue, since we maintain a decreasing queue.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
