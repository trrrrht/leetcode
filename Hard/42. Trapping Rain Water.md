**Problem:**

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is `1`, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

**Example 1:**

![img](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/10/22/rainwatertrap.png)

```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == height.length`
- `0 <= n <= 3 * 104`
- `0 <= height[i] <= 105`

**My Solution:**
```
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int size = height.size();
        vector<int> leftmax(size);
        vector<int> rightmax(size);
        int area = 0;
        int lmax = 0;
        int rmax = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            leftmax[i] = lmax;
            if (lmax < height[i]) {
                lmax = height[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightmax[i] = rmax;
            if (rmax < height[i]) {
                rmax = height[i];
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            int tmp = min(leftmax[i], rightmax[i]) - height[i];
            if (tmp > 0) {
                area += tmp;
            }
        }
        return area;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each blank, the max rain it can trap depends on the smaller one between max left and max right boundary (check fish tank with fake mountains in it to see this rule). In that case, after finding the leftmax and rightmax for each blank, we can solve this problem.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

**Other Solution:**
```
int trap(vector<int>& height) {
        int size = height.size();
        int left = 0;
        int right = size - 1;
        int leftmax = 0;
        int rightmax = 0;
        int area = 0;
        while(left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftmax) {
                    leftmax = height[left];
                }
                else {
                    area += leftmax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            }
            else {
                if (height[right] >= rightmax) {
                    rightmax = height[right];
                }
                else {
                    area += rightmax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        return area;
    }
```

Correctness:

This idea is based on the one in the former solution. We should find max left and max right boundary for each blank. However, by using two pointers, we can solve this problem easily. 

As we know, the water trapped in blank is limitted by the smaller one between leftmax and rightmax. In that case, to find new left or right boundary, we should move the smaller one. And for each blank we can just use the leftmax or rightmax now to calculate the water it traps.

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(1)
