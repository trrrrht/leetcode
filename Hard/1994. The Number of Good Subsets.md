**Problem:**
You are given an integer array `nums`. We call a subset of `nums` **good** if its product can be represented as a product of one or more **distinct prime** numbers.

- For example, if

   

  ```
  nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

  :

  - `[2, 3]`, `[1, 2, 3]`, and `[1, 3]` are **good** subsets with products `6 = 2*3`, `6 = 2*3`, and `3 = 3` respectively.
  - `[1, 4]` and `[4]` are not **good** subsets with products `4 = 2*2` and `4 = 2*2` respectively.

Return *the number of different **good** subsets in* `nums` ***modulo*** `109 + 7`.

A **subset** of `nums` is any array that can be obtained by deleting some (possibly none or all) elements from `nums`. Two subsets are different if and only if the chosen indices to delete are different.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [1,2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [1,2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [1,3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,2,3,15]
Output: 5
Explanation: The good subsets are:
- [2]: product is 2, which is the product of distinct prime 2.
- [2,3]: product is 6, which is the product of distinct primes 2 and 3.
- [2,15]: product is 30, which is the product of distinct primes 2, 3, and 5.
- [3]: product is 3, which is the product of distinct prime 3.
- [15]: product is 15, which is the product of distinct primes 3 and 5.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`
**Other Solution:**
```
#define vi vector<int>
#define ll long long

ll mod = 1e9+7;
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfGoodSubsets(vi& nums) {
        
        unordered_map<int, int>m;
        int ones = 0, res=0;
        
        int prime[10] = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};
        
        vi dp(1<<10, 0), tmp;
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for(auto x:nums){
            if(x%4==0 || x%9==0 || x%25==0) continue; 
            if(x==1) ones++;         
            else m[x]++;
        }
        
        for(auto x:m){
            
            int curr_mask = 0;
            for(int i=0; i<10; i++)
                if(x.first%prime[i]==0) 
                    curr_mask+=(1<<i);
            
            tmp.assign(1<<10, 0);
            for(int mask=0; mask<(1<<10); mask++)
                if( (curr_mask & mask) ==0)
                    tmp[mask | curr_mask] = ((ll) dp[mask]*(ll) x.second)%mod; 
            for(int i=0; i<(1<<10); i++)
                dp[i] = (dp[i]+tmp[i] )%mod;
            
        }
    
        for(int i=1; i<(1<<10); i++) res =(res+dp[i] )%mod;
        
        while(ones--){
            res = ( (ll)res*2LL)%mod;
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```
Correctness:

For each number in the array, we should check the prime factors of it. Since we want to find distinct prime factors, we should check each number to find the combination

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(n)
