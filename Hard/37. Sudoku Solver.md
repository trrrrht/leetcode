**Problem:**
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.

A sudoku solution must satisfy **all of the following rules**:

1. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each row.
2. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each column.
3. Each of the digits `1-9` must occur exactly once in each of the 9 `3x3` sub-boxes of the grid.

The `'.'` character indicates empty cells.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: board = [["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."],["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."],[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."],["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"],["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"],["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"],[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."],[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"],[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: [["5","3","4","6","7","8","9","1","2"],["6","7","2","1","9","5","3","4","8"],["1","9","8","3","4","2","5","6","7"],["8","5","9","7","6","1","4","2","3"],["4","2","6","8","5","3","7","9","1"],["7","1","3","9","2","4","8","5","6"],["9","6","1","5","3","7","2","8","4"],["2","8","7","4","1","9","6","3","5"],["3","4","5","2","8","6","1","7","9"]]
Explanation: The input board is shown above and the only valid solution is shown below:
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `board.length == 9`
- `board[i].length == 9`
- `board[i][j]` is a digit or `'.'`.
- It is **guaranteed** that the input board has only one solution.
**Other Solution:**
```
bool check(vector<vector<char>> &board, int i, int j, char val)
    {
        int row = i - i%3, column = j - j%3;
        for(int x=0; x<9; x++) if(board[x][j] == val) return false;
        for(int y=0; y<9; y++) if(board[i][y] == val) return false;
        for(int x=0; x<3; x++)
        for(int y=0; y<3; y++)
            if(board[row+x][column+y] == val) return false;
        return true;
    }
    bool solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>> &board, int i, int j)
    {
        if(i==9) return true;
        if(j==9) return solveSudoku(board, i+1, 0);
        if(board[i][j] != '.') return solveSudoku(board, i, j+1);

        for(char c='1'; c<='9'; c++)
        {
            if(check(board, i, j, c))
            {
                board[i][j] = c;
                if(solveSudoku(board, i, j+1)) return true;
                board[i][j] = '.';
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
    void solveSudoku(vector<vector<char>>& board) {
        solveSudoku(board, 0, 0);
    }
```
Correctness:

For each number in 1-9, for each cell, we should search the row, column and sub-sudo of it to see whether the value has appeared.

Complexity:

Time: O($n^2$)
Space: O(1)
