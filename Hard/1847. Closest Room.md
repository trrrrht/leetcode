**Problem:**
There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomIdi, sizei]` denotes that there is a room with room number `roomIdi` and size equal to `sizei`. Each `roomIdi` is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given `k` queries in a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferredj, minSizej]`. The answer to the `jth` query is the room number `id` of a room such that:

- The room has a size of **at least** `minSizej`, and
- `abs(id - preferredj)` is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is **no such room**, the answer is `-1`.

Return *an array* `answer` *of length* `k` *where* `answer[j]` *contains the answer to the* `jth` *query*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]
Output: [3,-1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.
Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.
Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: rooms = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]], queries = [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [2,1,3]
Explanation: The answers to the queries are as follows:
Query = [2,3]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.
Query = [2,4]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.
Query = [2,5]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `n == rooms.length`
- `1 <= n <= 105`
- `k == queries.length`
- `1 <= k <= 104`
- `1 <= roomIdi, preferredj <= 107`
- `1 <= sizei, minSizej <= 107`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> closestRoom(vector<vector<int>>& rooms, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        for(int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) queries[i].push_back(i);

        sort(queries.begin(), queries.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b) {
            
            return a[1] > b[1];
        });
        sort(rooms.begin(), rooms.end(), [](auto &a, auto &b){
            return a[1] > b[1];
        });
        int i = 0;
        set<int> st;
        vector<int> ans(queries.size());
        for(auto q : queries) {
            int prefer = q[0], minSize = q[1], idx = q[2];
            while(i < rooms.size() && rooms[i][1] >= minSize)
                st.insert(rooms[i++][0]);
            if(st.size()) {
                auto it = st.upper_bound(prefer);
                int res = it != st.end() ? abs(*it - prefer) : INT_MAX;
                int resRoomId = it != st.end() ? *it : INT_MAX;
                if(it != st.begin()) {
                    --it;
                    if(abs(*it - prefer) <= res)
                        resRoomId = *it;
                }
                ans[idx] = resRoomId;
            }else
                ans[idx] = -1;
        }
        return ans;
    }
```
Correctness:

Because we need the room which has minSize by the given query, so we can iterate from the largest minSize query and put all the valid room to an ordered set, and then do binary search to get room id in the ordered set.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
