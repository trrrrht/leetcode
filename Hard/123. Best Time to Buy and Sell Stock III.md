**Problem:**
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete **at most two transactions**.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: prices = [1]
Output: 0
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= prices.length <= 105`
- `0 <= prices[i] <= 105`

**My Solution:**
```
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int leftmax = 0;
        int rightmax = 0;
        int leftmin = 10e5 + 1;
        prices.emplace_back(0);
        int size = prices.size();
        vector<int> leftprofit;
        int maxprofit = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            if (leftmin > prices[i]) {
                leftmin = prices[i];
            }
            int profit = prices[i] - leftmin;
            leftprofit.emplace_back(leftmax);
            if (profit > leftmax) {
                leftmax = profit;
            }
        }
        for (int i = size - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (rightmax < prices[i]) {
                rightmax = prices[i];
            }
            int profit = rightmax - prices[i];
            leftprofit[i] += profit;
            if (maxprofit < leftprofit[i]) {
                maxprofit = leftprofit[i];
            }
        }
        return maxprofit;
    }
```
Correctness:

In this problem, we can at most do two transactions, so we have to find the maximum two profits. In that case, for each stock, we should find the maximum profit of its left and then check whether itself can be bought to get the maximum profit of the right part of the array (If we do this, we can get the maximum profit for each stock in at most two transactions). 

Complexity:

Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)

**Other Solution:**
```
int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
    int buy1 = INT_MIN, sale1 = 0, buy2 = INT_MIN, sale2 = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<prices.size(); i++){                   
        buy1 = max(buy1, -prices[i]);                 
        sale1 = max(sale1, prices[i] + buy1);       
        buy2 = max(buy2, sale1 - prices[i]);         
        sale2 = max(sale2, prices[i] + buy2);       
    }
    return sale2;
}
```
Correctness:

The buy1 represents when we buy the lowest price stock, the money we have. The sale1 represents when we sell the first stock in the highest profit, the profit we get. The sale2 represents when we buy the second stock after the first sale, the money we have. The sale2 represents when we have done the two sales, the profit we get.

In that case, the sale1 will always represents the left max profit of a stock. And we can use buy2 to get the right max profit of it.
