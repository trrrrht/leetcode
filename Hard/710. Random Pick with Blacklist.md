**Problem:**
Given a blacklist `blacklist` containing unique integers from `[0, n)`, write a function to return a uniform random integer from `[0, n)` which is **NOT** in `blacklist`.

Optimize it such that it minimizes the call to systemâ€™s `Math.random()`.

**Note:**

1. `1 <= n <= 1000000000`
2. `0 <= blacklist.length < min(100000, n)`
3. `[0, n)` does NOT include n. See [interval notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interval_(mathematics)).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[1,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,0]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[2,[]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,1,1]
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[3,[1]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,0,0,2]
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: 
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[4,[2]],[],[],[]]
Output: [null,1,3,1]
```

**Explanation of Input Syntax:**

The input is two lists: the subroutines called and their arguments. `Solution`'s constructor has two arguments, `n` and the blacklist `blacklist`. `pick` has no arguments. Arguments are always wrapped with a list, even if there aren't any.
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> v;
    std::mt19937 gen;
    std::uniform_int_distribution<> dis;
    Solution(int N, vector<int> blacklist) {
        v = blacklist;
        sort(v.begin(), v.end());
        v.push_back(N);
        for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) v[i] -= i;
        
        std::random_device rd; 
        gen = std::mt19937(rd());
        dis = std::uniform_int_distribution<>(0, N - v.size());
    }
    
    int pick() {
        int rnd = dis(gen);
        auto it = upper_bound(v.begin(), v.end(), rnd) - 1;
        int idx = it - v.begin();
        return idx + rnd + 1;
    }
```
Correctness:

Since we want to find the number that is not in the list, we should remap the original array to a smaller scale. Then we use random to generate a uniform random value and use binary search to find the corresponding idx of it. When we add the random value and the index, we could get the original value that is not in the blacklist

Complexity:

Time: O(logn)
Space: O(n)
