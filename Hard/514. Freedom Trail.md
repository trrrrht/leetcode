**Problem:**
In the video game Fallout 4, the quest **"Road to Freedom"** requires players to reach a metal dial called the **"Freedom Trail Ring"** and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to open the door.

Given a string `ring` that represents the code engraved on the outer ring and another string `key` that represents the keyword that needs to be spelled, return *the minimum number of steps to spell all the characters in the keyword*.

Initially, the first character of the ring is aligned at the `"12:00"` direction. You should spell all the characters in `key` one by one by rotating `ring` clockwise or anticlockwise to make each character of the string key aligned at the `"12:00"` direction and then by pressing the center button.

At the stage of rotating the ring to spell the key character `key[i]`:

1. You can rotate the ring clockwise or anticlockwise by one place, which counts as **one step**. The final purpose of the rotation is to align one of `ring`'s characters at the `"12:00"` direction, where this character must equal `key[i]`.
2. If the character `key[i]` has been aligned at the `"12:00"` direction, press the center button to spell, which also counts as **one step**. After the pressing, you could begin to spell the next character in the key (next stage). Otherwise, you have finished all the spelling.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "gd"
Output: 4
Explanation:
For the first key character 'g', since it is already in place, we just need 1 step to spell this character. 
For the second key character 'd', we need to rotate the ring "godding" anticlockwise by two steps to make it become "ddinggo".
Also, we need 1 more step for spelling.
So the final output is 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: ring = "godding", key = "godding"
Output: 13
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= ring.length, key.length <= 100`
- `ring` and `key` consist of only lower case English letters.
- It is guaranteed that `key` could always be spelled by rotating `ring`.
**Other Solution:**
```
int findRotateSteps(string ring, string key) {
        int size = ring.size();
        int ksize = key.size();
        vector<vector<int>> mp(26); 
        for(int i=0;i<size;++i){
            mp[ring[i]-'a'].push_back(i);
        }
        
        vector<int> dp (size,INT_MAX); 
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        vector<int> startIndex(1,0);

        for(int i=1;i<=ksize;++i){
            vector<int> nextDp(size,INT_MAX);
            for(auto it:mp[key[i-1]-'a']){
                for(int j=0;j<startIndex.size();++j){
                    int minDist = min((startIndex[j] + size -it)%size,(it + size - startIndex[j])%size) + dp[startIndex[j]];
                    nextDp[it] =min(nextDp[it],minDist);
                }
            }
            startIndex = mp[key[i-1]-'a'];
            dp = nextDp;
        }
        
        int res = INT_MAX;
        for(int i=0;i<size;++i){
            res = min(res,dp[i]);
        } 
        
        return res + ksize;
    }
```
Correctness:

For each step of rotation, we just check the distance between the current char and the aim char (if multiple chars, find the cloest one)

Complexity:

Time: O($n^3$)
Space: O(n)
