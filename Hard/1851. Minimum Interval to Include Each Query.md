**Problem:**
You are given a 2D integer array `intervals`, where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` describes the `ith` interval starting at `lefti` and ending at `righti` **(inclusive)**. The **size** of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally `righti - lefti + 1`.

You are also given an integer array `queries`. The answer to the `jth` query is the **size of the smallest interval** `i` such that `lefti <= queries[j] <= righti`. If no such interval exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return *an array containing the answers to the queries*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6],[4,4]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,1,4]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 3: The interval [2,4] is the smallest interval containing 3. The answer is 4 - 2 + 1 = 3.
- Query = 4: The interval [4,4] is the smallest interval containing 4. The answer is 4 - 4 + 1 = 1.
- Query = 5: The interval [3,6] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 6 - 3 + 1 = 4.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[2,3],[2,5],[1,8],[20,25]], queries = [2,19,5,22]
Output: [2,-1,4,6]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- Query = 2: The interval [2,3] is the smallest interval containing 2. The answer is 3 - 2 + 1 = 2.
- Query = 19: None of the intervals contain 19. The answer is -1.
- Query = 5: The interval [2,5] is the smallest interval containing 5. The answer is 5 - 2 + 1 = 4.
- Query = 22: The interval [20,25] is the smallest interval containing 22. The answer is 25 - 20 + 1 = 6.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 105`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 105`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= lefti <= righti <= 107`
- `1 <= queries[j] <= 107`
**Other Solution:**
```
vector<int> minInterval(vector<vector<int>>& A, vector<int>& queries) {
        priority_queue<vector<int>> pq;
        unordered_map<int, int> res;
        vector<int> Q = queries, res2;
        sort(A.begin(), A.end());
        sort(Q.begin(), Q.end());
        int i = 0, n = A.size();
        for (int q : Q) {
            while (i < n && A[i][0] <= q) {
                int l = A[i][0], r = A[i++][1];
                pq.push({l - r - 1, r});
            }
            while (pq.size() && pq.top()[1] < q)
                pq.pop();
            res[q] = pq.size() ? -pq.top()[0] : -1;
        }
        for (int q : queries)
            res2.push_back(res[q]);
        return res2;
    }
```
Correctness:

Sort queries and intervals.
Iterate queries from small to big,
and find out all open intervals [l, r],
and we add them to a priority queue.
Also, we need to remove all closed interval from the queue.In the priority, we use[interval size, interval end] = [r-l+1, r] as the key.The head of the queue is the smallest interval we want to return for each query.

Complexity:

Time: O(nlogn)
Space: O(n)
