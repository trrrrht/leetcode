**Problem:**
An N x N `board` contains only `0`s and `1`s. In each move, you can swap any 2 rows with each other, or any 2 columns with each other.

What is the minimum number of moves to transform the board into a "chessboard" - a board where no `0`s and no `1`s are 4-directionally adjacent? If the task is impossible, return -1.

```
Examples:
Input: board = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation:
One potential sequence of moves is shown below, from left to right:

0110     1010     1010
0110 --> 1010 --> 0101
1001     0101     1010
1001     0101     0101

The first move swaps the first and second column.
The second move swaps the second and third row.


Input: board = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
Also note that the board with 0 in the top left corner,
01
10

is also a valid chessboard.

Input: board = [[1, 0], [1, 0]]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No matter what sequence of moves you make, you cannot end with a valid chessboard.
```

**Note:**

- `board` will have the same number of rows and columns, a number in the range `[2, 30]`.
- `board[i][j]` will be only `0`s or `1`s.
**Other Solution:**
```
int movesToChessboard(vector<vector<int>>& board) {
        int n = board.size();
        int row_counter = 0, col_counter = 0;
        for(int r = 0; r < n; r++){
            row_counter += board[r][0] ? 1 : -1;
            for(int c = 0; c < n; c++){
                if(r == 0) col_counter += board[r][c] ? 1 : -1;
                if((board[r][0] ^ board[0][0]) ^ (board[r][c] ^ board[0][c])) return -1; 
            }
        }
        if(abs(row_counter) > 1 || abs(col_counter) > 1) return -1;
        int row_swap_count = 0, col_swap_count = 0, row_0_count = 0, col_0_count = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            if(i & 1){ 
                row_swap_count += board[i][0];
                col_swap_count += board[0][i];
            }
            row_0_count += board[i][0] == 0, col_0_count += board[0][i] == 0;            
        }
        
        int odd_position_count = n/2; 
        if(n & 1){ 
            row_swap_count = row_0_count == odd_position_count ? row_swap_count : (odd_position_count - row_swap_count);
            col_swap_count = col_0_count == odd_position_count ? col_swap_count : (odd_position_count - col_swap_count);
        }
        else{
            row_swap_count = min(row_swap_count, odd_position_count - row_swap_count);
            col_swap_count = min(col_swap_count, odd_position_count - col_swap_count);            
        }
        
        return row_swap_count + col_swap_count;
    }
```
Correctness:

We know if we want to transform the matrix to chessboard, the matrix should have and only have two different rows(columns) and these two types must be inverted(one is 1, the other should be 0). Otherwise, it can't be transformed to chessboard. For example, if we have one row is [0, 1], one is [1, 0], we know they are inverted and can be chessboard. However, if there is another one [0, 0] which is different from both of the first two, we can see no matter how we change the order of the row or column, we can know get chessboard.

Except for this rule, we have a second rule. The difference of the numbers of these two types is at most 1. For example, if the difference is 2, and the row is [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1], the [0, 0] must be the neighbour row with another [0, 0].

In the algorithm, we first check the rule 1. As we know from rule 1 and rule 2, we can just count the number of 1 in first row and first column to see whether the difference is smaller than or equal to 1. Also we can use XOR to see whether every row and column is inverted or the same.

And also, we know the odd row (column) is less or equal to the even row (column), so we should count the number of the first element of row (column) is 0. If it's equal to the number of the odd row (column), we know we should put all this type row (column) at odd row (column). Otherwise we should put it at even row (column).

Time: O($n^2$) 
Space: O(1)
