**Problem:**
This is an ***interactive problem\***.

You are given an array of **unique** strings `wordlist` where `wordlist[i]` is `6` letters long, and one word in this list is chosen as `secret`.

You may call `Master.guess(word)` to guess a word. The guessed word should have type `string` and must be from the original list with `6` lowercase letters.

This function returns an `integer` type, representing the number of exact matches (value and position) of your guess to the `secret` word. Also, if your guess is not in the given wordlist, it will return `-1` instead.

For each test case, you have exactly `10` guesses to guess the word. At the end of any number of calls, if you have made `10` or fewer calls to `Master.guess` and at least one of these guesses was `secret`, then you pass the test case.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: secret = "acckzz", wordlist = ["acckzz","ccbazz","eiowzz","abcczz"], numguesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
Explanation:
master.guess("aaaaaa") returns -1, because "aaaaaa" is not in wordlist.
master.guess("acckzz") returns 6, because "acckzz" is secret and has all 6 matches.
master.guess("ccbazz") returns 3, because "ccbazz" has 3 matches.
master.guess("eiowzz") returns 2, because "eiowzz" has 2 matches.
master.guess("abcczz") returns 4, because "abcczz" has 4 matches.
We made 5 calls to master.guess and one of them was the secret, so we pass the test case.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: secret = "hamada", wordlist = ["hamada","khaled"], numguesses = 10
Output: You guessed the secret word correctly.
```

 

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= wordlist.length <= 100`
- `wordlist[i].length == 6`
- `wordlist[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings of `wordlist` are **unique**.
- `secret` exists in `wordlist`.
- `numguesses == 10`
**Other Solution:**
```
int match(string a, string b) {
        int matches = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length(); ++i)
            if (a[i] == b[i])
                matches ++;
        return matches;
    }
    void findSecretWord(vector<string>& wordlist, Master& master) {
        int count[6][26], x = 0, best;
        for (int t = 0; t < 10 && x < 6; ++t) {
            memset(count, 0, 156 * sizeof(int));
            for (string w : wordlist)
                for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
                    count[i][w[i] - 'a']++;
            best = 0;
            string guess = wordlist[0];
            for (string w: wordlist) {
                int score = 0;
                for (int i = 0; i < 6; ++i)
                    score += count[i][w[i] - 'a'];
                if (score > best) {
                    guess = w;
                    best = score;
                }
            }
            x = master.guess(guess);
            vector<string> wordlist2;
            for (string w : wordlist)
                if (match(guess, w) == x)
                    wordlist2.push_back(w);
            wordlist = wordlist2;
        }
    }
```
Correctness:

We could use minmax idea
